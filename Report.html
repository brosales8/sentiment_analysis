/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<hr>
<p>Now that we have a basic understanding of how SageMaker works we will try to use it to construct a complete project from end to end. Our goal will be to have a simple web page which a user can use to enter a movie review. The web page will then send the review off to our deployed model which will predict the sentiment of the entered review.</p>
<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions<a class="anchor-link" href="#Instructions">&#182;</a></h2><p>Some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this notebook. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with '<strong>TODO</strong>' in the header indicate that you need to complete or implement some portion within them. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a <code># TODO: ...</code> comment. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!</p>
<p>In addition to implementing code, there will be questions for you to answer which relate to the task and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a '<strong>Question:</strong>' header. Carefully read each question and provide your answer below the '<strong>Answer:</strong>' header by editing the Markdown cell.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: Code and Markdown cells can be executed using the <strong>Shift+Enter</strong> keyboard shortcut. In addition, a cell can be edited by typically clicking it (double-click for Markdown cells) or by pressing <strong>Enter</strong> while it is highlighted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="General-Outline">General Outline<a class="anchor-link" href="#General-Outline">&#182;</a></h2><p>Recall the general outline for SageMaker projects using a notebook instance.</p>
<ol>
<li>Download or otherwise retrieve the data.</li>
<li>Process / Prepare the data.</li>
<li>Upload the processed data to S3.</li>
<li>Train a chosen model.</li>
<li>Test the trained model (typically using a batch transform job).</li>
<li>Deploy the trained model.</li>
<li>Use the deployed model.</li>
</ol>
<p>For this project, you will be following the steps in the general outline with some modifications.</p>
<p>First, you will not be testing the model in its own step. You will still be testing the model, however, you will do it by deploying your model and then using the deployed model by sending the test data to it. One of the reasons for doing this is so that you can make sure that your deployed model is working correctly before moving forward.</p>
<p>In addition, you will deploy and use your trained model a second time. In the second iteration you will customize the way that your trained model is deployed by including some of your own code. In addition, your newly deployed model will be used in the sentiment analysis web app.</p>

<pre>Lexi befriends Jennifer, a thin, intelligent girl at her new school. Lexi&#39;s parents have just split up. Soon, Jen tells Lexi of her eating disorder, and the two begin dieting and exercising together. They both are in the school&#39;s volley ball team. Lexi&#39;s mum becomes aware of her daughter&#39;s illness, as she is losing lots of weight. Lexi is admitted to hospital. She is diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa, and is made to gain weight. Her father visits her in hospital, and orders a feeding tube. She is better and is allowed out of hospital and she tells her mum that Jen has bulimia. This leads to the two falling out, as Lexi&#39;s mum tells Jen&#39;s mum her suspicions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a party Jen is hit by a car, and because her heart is weak it kills her. Lexi&#39;s condition worsens, as she blames herself for her best friend&#39;s death...

<p>The method below applies the <code>review_to_words</code> method to each of the reviews in the training and testing datasets. In addition it caches the results. This is because performing this processing step can take a long time. This way if you are unable to complete the notebook in the current session, you can come back without needing to process the data a second time.</p>

<h2 id="Transform-the-data">Transform the data<a class="anchor-link" href="#Transform-the-data">&#182;</a></h2><p>In the XGBoost notebook we transformed the data from its word representation to a bag-of-words feature representation. For the model we are going to construct in this notebook we will construct a feature representation which is very similar. To start, we will represent each word as an integer. Of course, some of the words that appear in the reviews occur very infrequently and so likely don't contain much information for the purposes of sentiment analysis. The way we will deal with this problem is that we will fix the size of our working vocabulary and we will only include the words that appear most frequently. We will then combine all of the infrequent words into a single category and, in our case, we will label it as <code>1</code>.</p>
<p>Since we will be using a recurrent neural network, it will be convenient if the length of each review is the same. To do this, we will fix a size for our reviews and then pad short reviews with the category 'no word' (which we will label <code>0</code>) and truncate long reviews.</p>

<h3 id="(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">(TODO) Create a word dictionary<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Create-a-word-dictionary">&#182;</a></h3><p>To begin with, we need to construct a way to map words that appear in the reviews to integers. Here we fix the size of our vocabulary (including the 'no word' and 'infrequent' categories) to be <code>5000</code> but you may wish to change this to see how it affects the model.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>TODO:</strong> Complete the implementation for the <code>build_dict()</code> method below. Note that even though the vocab_size is set to <code>5000</code>, we only want to construct a mapping for the most frequently appearing <code>4998</code> words. This is because we want to reserve the special labels <code>0</code> for 'no word' and <code>1</code> for 'infrequent word'.</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>The top 5 frequently words make completely sense, they are related to movie topics when writting reviews or opinions about a film. However, 'one' and 'like' could be words used for a person when expressing an idea.</p>

<p><strong>Question:</strong> In the cells above we use the <code>preprocess_data</code> and <code>convert_and_pad_data</code> methods to process both the training and testing set. Why or why not might this be a problem?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>We need to process training and testing data set since our model will require the frequency words encoded. For such reason, we are using a codification for each frequency word we built in our dictionary. Also, the application of a Pad allows standarize the size of the review in terms of number of words. However, my concern is that there are 2 categories 0: 'No Word' and 1:'Infrequent' which can affect the model to learn from data. In other words, if we take a look of the above histogram, we realize that most of the reviews (around 23,500 out of 25,000 reviews ) contain less than 300 frequents words which produces a huge amount of 0: 'No word' class to fit the pad of 500 words and as a consequence it could be a problem for the model to generalize.</p>

<h3 id="Save-the-processed-training-dataset-locally">Save the processed training dataset locally<a class="anchor-link" href="#Save-the-processed-training-dataset-locally">&#182;</a></h3><p>It is important to note the format of the data that we are saving as we will need to know it when we write the training code. In our case, each row of the dataset has the form <code>label</code>, <code>length</code>, <code>review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers representing the words in the review.</p>

In particular, a model comprises three objects</p>
<ul>
<li>Model Artifacts,</li>
<li>Training Code, and</li>
<li>Inference Code,</li>
</ul>
<p>each of which interact with one another. In the XGBoost example we used training and inference code that was provided by Amazon. Here we will still be using containers provided by Amazon with the added benefit of being able to include our own custom code.</p>
<p>We will start by implementing our own neural network in PyTorch along with a training script. For the purposes of this project we have provided the necessary model object in the <code>model.py</code> file, inside of the <code>train</code> folder. You can see the provided implementation by running the cell below.</p>

<p>The important takeaway from the implementation provided is that there are three parameters that we may wish to tweak to improve the performance of our model. These are the embedding dimension, the hidden dimension and the size of the vocabulary. We will likely want to make these parameters configurable in the training script so that if we wish to modify them we do not need to modify the script itself. We will see how to do this later on. To start we will write some of the training code in the notebook so that we can more easily diagnose any issues that arise.</p>
<p>First we will load a small portion of the training data set to use as a sample. It would be very time consuming to try and train the model completely in the notebook as we do not have access to a gpu and the compute instance that we are using is not particularly powerful. However, we can work on a small bit of the data to get a feel for how our training script is behaving.</p>

<h2 id="Step-5:-Testing-the-model">Step 5: Testing the model<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-5:-Testing-the-model">&#182;</a></h2><p>As mentioned at the top of this notebook, we will be testing this model by first deploying it and then sending the testing data to the deployed endpoint. We will do this so that we can make sure that the deployed model is working correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">Step 6: Deploy the model for testing<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-6:-Deploy-the-model-for-testing">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have trained our model, we would like to test it to see how it performs. Currently our model takes input of the form <code>review_length, review[500]</code> where <code>review[500]</code> is a sequence of <code>500</code> integers which describe the words present in the review, encoded using <code>word_dict</code>. Fortunately for us, SageMaker provides built-in inference code for models with simple inputs such as this.</p>
<p>There is one thing that we need to provide, however, and that is a function which loads the saved model. This function must be called <code>model_fn()</code> and takes as its only parameter a path to the directory where the model artifacts are stored. This function must also be present in the python file which we specified as the entry point. In our case the model loading function has been provided and so no changes need to be made.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: When the built-in inference code is run it must import the <code>model_fn()</code> method from the <code>train.py</code> file. This is why the training code is wrapped in a main guard ( ie, <code>if __name__ == '__main__':</code> )</p>
<p>Since we don't need to change anything in the code that was uploaded during training, we can simply deploy the current model as-is.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> When deploying a model you are asking SageMaker to launch an compute instance that will wait for data to be sent to it. As a result, this compute instance will continue to run until <em>you</em> shut it down. This is important to know since the cost of a deployed endpoint depends on how long it has been running for.</p>
<p>In other words <strong>If you are no longer using a deployed endpoint, shut it down!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>XGBoost Accuracy Score: 0.86116</p>
<p>Recurrent NN: 0.8427</p>
<p>Both scores are similar, but XGBoost algorithm performed a litte bit higher. Personally, I believe LSTM is more suitable for this problem since it is design to try with sequential data and this case is not an exemption. The words are encoded sequentially in the dictionary and in my prospection LSTM can take more advantage of that than XGBoost. I think that LSTM could perform better if more tunning is made. On the other hand, I recommend to play with a pad=300 since the reviews look to be short and the padding method is aggregating many 'no word" class to the data which might be affecting the model negatively.</p>

<ul>
<li>Removed any html tags and stemmed the input</li>
<li>Encoded the review as a sequence of integers using <code>word_dict</code></li>

<p>In order process the review we will need to repeat these two steps.</p>

<p>As we saw above, by default the estimator which we created, when deployed, will use the entry script and directory which we provided when creating the model. However, since we now wish to accept a string as input and our model expects a processed review, we need to write some custom inference code.</p>
<p>We will store the code that we write in the <code>serve</code> directory. Provided in this directory is the <code>model.py</code> file that we used to construct our model, a <code>utils.py</code> file which contains the <code>review_to_words</code> and <code>convert_and_pad</code> pre-processing functions which we used during the initial data processing, and <code>predict.py</code>, the file which will contain our custom inference code. Note also that <code>requirements.txt</code> is present which will tell SageMaker what Python libraries are required by our custom inference code.</p>
<p>When deploying a PyTorch model in SageMaker, you are expected to provide four functions which the SageMaker inference container will use.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>model_fn</code>: This function is the same function that we used in the training script and it tells SageMaker how to load our model.</li>
<li><code>input_fn</code>: This function receives the raw serialized input that has been sent to the model's endpoint and its job is to de-serialize and make the input available for the inference code.</li>
<li><code>output_fn</code>: This function takes the output of the inference code and its job is to serialize this output and return it to the caller of the model's endpoint.</li>
<li><code>predict_fn</code>: The heart of the inference script, this is where the actual prediction is done and is the function which you will need to complete.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the simple website that we are constructing during this project, the <code>input_fn</code> and <code>output_fn</code> methods are relatively straightforward. We only require being able to accept a string as input and we expect to return a single value as output. You might imagine though that in a more complex application the input or output may be image data or some other binary data which would require some effort to serialize.</p>
<h3 id="(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">(TODO) Writing inference code<a class="anchor-link" href="#(TODO)-Writing-inference-code">&#182;</a></h3><p>Before writing our custom inference code, we will begin by taking a look at the code which has been provided.</p>

To begin with, we need to construct a new PyTorchModel object which points to the model artifacts created during training and also points to the inference code that we wish to use. Then we can call the deploy method to launch the deployment container.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: The default behaviour for a deployed PyTorch model is to assume that any input passed to the predictor is a <code>numpy</code> array. In our case we want to send a string so we need to construct a simple wrapper around the <code>RealTimePredictor</code> class to accomodate simple strings. In a more complicated situation you may want to provide a serialization object, for example if you wanted to sent image data.</p>

b&#39;Thomas Mann\&#39;s controversial novel is the basis for the film &#34;A Death in Venice. &#34; Although in the book, the hero is an author, in the film the director Luchino Visconti who also wrote the screenplay, transforms him into a Composer. As such, the Author/Composer, Gustav Von Aschebach (Dirk Bogarde) on the verge of mental exhaustion is a burned-out artisan. After a long and successful career now seeks the peace and tranquility of a less hectic life. He decides to go on vacation to Venice where he hopes to rejuvenate his dwindling ambition. However, while staying at the picturesque seaside resort, he captures the attention of a beautiful young teenage boy, Tadzio (Bj\xc3\xb6rn Andr\xc3\xa9sen) who eyes him with curious interest and is immediately smitten by him. Although Gustav is captivated by the wondrous youth, he nevertheless must find some private time away from the boy\&#39;s governess (Nora Ricci), while having to cope with a invading plague which seems to have infested the city. The movie dialog, like the novel remains subtle as are the few brief encounters between the boy and the artist. In the end. the audience unlike the book is hampered with innuendos and imaginative flights of fancy. Their affair is never given wing, substance or opportunity and were it not for the brief resolution in the book, the film allows only the possibility of \&#39;what if.\&#39; Nevertheless, one can sympathize with the hero and wish him a moment\&#39;s peace to obtain that which is forbidden, elusive but definitely criticized by prying eyes. Great story and a Bogarde Classic. ****&#39;

b&#39;OK, yes its bad, yes its complete fluff, yes it makes dobbin the mule look like an Oscar winner but look at it like i did i was 13, special effects were pretty much non exsistant in 90% of films, back in the good Ole days when films needed a story line.. OK so even the storyline is a bit dodgy.. but wow did i get into this film as a kid in the 80s. cheesy rock, bad special effects, but airplanes an aerial fights and it had queens one vision on the soundtrack.. see even the worst things have a silver lining.. all in all if you want a bad film to show a 12 year old who hates computer effects (if there is such a film) this is the ideal choice&#39;

b&#34;When I first saw this show, I was 9, and it caught my attention right away when Stewie was trying to call Lois on the phone in the hotel. I laughed and kept on watching. When the episode was finished, i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly. This separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows on say, Cartoon Network because the jokes are more mature, not too much, but it&#39;s TV-14 for a reason. The quick film cuts after each punch line and cute, funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special. Talented Seth Macfarlene is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show. A good theme song, and a crazy family that there&#39;s always something funny, makes this my favorite cartoon along Sealab 2021 and Aqua Teen Hunger Force. Check it out it&#39;s funny stuff.&#34;

b&#39;DON\&#39;T LOOK IN THE BASEMENT This little forgotten gem holds a special place in my heart and on the Video Nasties List. The flute-sitar-rattle box soundtrack is classic. The main character, although way hotter than most low budget starlets, is a pretty standard low budget lead. The Doctor Masters character is well written and well acted. Some of the lesser characters are kinda stupid but add to the nostalgia of the movie. It\&#39;s Campy. I ain\&#39;t trying to lie. The character that makes this great is a Faulknarian Man-Child named Sam, one of the patients in this sanitarium-gone-mad-flick. The gore is pretty standard although I think the color of the blood is awesome. It\&#39;s so ..Red. This movie, I believe, was received poorly because of it advertising scheme. Some soulless little ad executive got his grubby hands on it and thought &#34; Let\&#39;s rip of the AD campaign for Last House on the Left, that\&#39;s doing well&#34;. Little chumps like this have ruined the world of film. All balls and no brain. Also, the editor may or may not have been an alcoholic. Maybe there all drunk. You\&#39;ll see what I mean. One more little note. Don\&#39;t buy this from the Wally-Mart dollar rack. They have cut it to and unwatchable level. Try to find the longest cut you can.&#39;

b&#34;This film is about aging Geisha in post war Tokyo. Okin, played by the incredible Haruko Sugimara, lends money to two other ex Geisha, Tamae (Chikako Hosokawa) and Otomi (Yuko Mochizuki) and they resent the way she is somewhat smug about it. Tamae has a son, Otomi a daughter, who during the film announce they&#39;re leaving them while Okin, never a mother, gets visits from two men in her past who, it turns out, just want money from her. Its a compelling tale of what choices you make, what you do to get through life and who you&#39;re responsible and beholden to. Haruko Sugimara has always been in my eyes one of the greatest character actresses ever from any country and she plays the mostly unyielding, less than compassionate Okin with an air of superiority that makes you not like her, but at the same time almost envy her. At a time when great films were made by Ozu, Mizoguchi, Kinoshita and Kurosawa, amongst others, Mr. Naruse is right up there with him. If you have a region free DVD player, you should attempt to find the two Naruse box sets released in England. I think this film was a great character study of women who are in danger of being irrelevant. That they are really not makes this film a veritable masterpiece.&#34;

b&#34;The movie is made in a style that resembles Lock, stock and two smoking barrels, with lot&#39;s of subplots, fancy camerawork, cool music and that great tongue-in-cheek Aussie type of humor you&#39;ll find nowhere else. How this movie has escaped the European and American audience is a mystery!&#34;

b&#39;This is a Black and White film from France,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple plot, gangster on the run seeking &amp; getting help etc. We have seen this type film many times over the years. What makes this film different are mainly its acting &amp; style. All the actors perform quietly,No one yells &amp; hardly anyone loses his temper. There are quite a few deaths, some surprising. There are beautiful women as well, but no sex scenes. No car chases either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUST talking/ It is so refreshing to listen to people talk, &amp; here we must read subtitles as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is near perfect by all. especially the lead played by &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lino Ventura &amp; in a smaller BUT vital role Jean Paul Belmondo. These 2 actors were among the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I said above the film is flawed, There are a few script deficiencies in few spots, They are minor,The acting is the thing in this movie. Production is first rate as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ratings: *** (out of 4) 88 points (out of 100) IMDb 8 (out of 10)&#39;

b&#39;I was five when the show made its debut in 1958 and at a later point, was a regular viewer. I remember that I really enjoyed the show, along with &#34;Leave It To Beaver&#34;, &#34;My Three Sons&#34;, &#34;Ozzie and Harriet&#34;, &#34;Dick Van Dyke&#34;, reruns of &#34;I Love Lucy&#34;, &#34;The Real McCoys&#34;, etc. I am now enjoying the first season of &#34;Donna Reed&#34; on DVD and have watched the first two episodes. Donna Stone is shown to be an intelligent, well-mannered, problem-solving, serene, stay-at-home mom, similar to June Cleaver and in contrast to Lucy Ricardo. In episode 2, I especially like how Ms. Reed becomes a surrogate dad, trading in her dress for sweats and boxing gloves, while teaching her son how to defend himself physically against a much larger bully. While none of the mothers in the neighborhood I grew up in, including my own, exactly met the idealistic standards portrayed by Ms. Reed, it is refreshing to see good manners and intelligent decision-making prevail at the end of the day, in contrast to today\&#39;s accepted standards of vulgarity, selfishness and indifference among one\&#39;s neighbors. I cannot imagine Jeff and Mary Stone being told by their parents that trespassing in their neighbors\&#39; yards is okay, leaving a dog outside to bark all day is acceptable, or telling their mother to &#34;shut up&#34; in a supermarket in front of everyone.&#39;

b&#39;Bobby and Mikey are two little boys who move across the country with their divorced mother to start a new life. Soon after the family settles in, their mom marries &#34;The King&#34; who ends up being an abusive stepfather, especially to Bobby. So Bobby decides that he will &#34;fly away&#34; from the abuse in his birthday present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was difficult to watch, especially the abuse scenes. It was hard to watch an innocent, playful little boy become abused and turn into a sullen scared, and withdrawn young man. The acting is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cried throughout the last half of the movie. There were some funny scenes in it too like the Monster Brew and the dog that finds the pop bottles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn\&#39;t suggest letting little kids watch it. It was a movie that was painful to watch and yet it really really flew away.&#39;

b&#34;This movie has to be seen for the music, which is actually a wonderful cantata composed by Sergei Prokofiev. Obviously, the original soundtrack is not exactly hi-fi, but there are many excellent versions available in classical music selections. The cantata can be appreciated for itself, but having seen the movie helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story itself is fairly standard Soviet wartime anti-German propaganda. An amusing anecdote is that Stalin was later so eager to buy time by appeasing Hitler at the onset of World War II that Eisenstein was seconded to a German movie for a short while, as penance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prince Alexander Nevsky (revered as a saint by the Russian Orthodox), having earned his nickname by defeating Swedish raiders on the river Neva, musters Russian resistance against an invasion by the Teutonic knights, and concludes his victory with a stern warning to other would-be invaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An interesting scene: Alexander sees a convoy of Russians being taken as slaves by Mongolian soldiers, and does nothing to stop this, as the Teutonic knights are his priority. The historical Alexander Nevsky paid tribute to the Mongol khans, as his father before him, while working to consolidate his realm&#39;s future independence.&#34;

b&#34;Now this is classic. A friend of mine told me about this flick, saying that it&#39;s incredibly lame, stupid, retarded, and moronic. He also said that I&#39;d love it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my surprise, I found it available from netflix and rented it at once. I&#39;m just shocked that I had never heard of it before. If I could give it an eleven, I would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#34;This was truly a tense and dark episode. Excellently executed, wonderful acting and atmospheric directing, &#39;Ice&#39; is one of my favorite episodes. Along with &#39;Pusher&#39; &#39;Grotesque&#39; &#39;Wetwired&#39; and &#39;Home&#39; (these are quite good in dark atmosphere in my case) It seem quite realistic to me, their paranoia, their suspicion and their ever growing rage was perfectly executed by the great actors. However, &#39;Ice&#39; had a problem that I got over after a few watches: IT WAS TOO SHORT! I WANTED MORE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, &#39;ice&#39; had what 98% of all X Files episodes have: Excellent acting, Intense story-writing, gritty directing. All the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 out of 10&#34;

b&#34;In Hong Kong, 1962, the editor Chow Mo-wan (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) and his wife, and the secretary Su Li-Zhen Chan (Maggie Cheung) and her husband simultaneously move to an old building. Each couple has just rented a room in apartments on the same floor. Their wife and husband stay most of the time away from home, and Chow and Li-Zhen have the same habits: they like kung-fu stories and noodles and soap from a restaurant nearby the building. Their close contact becomes friendship and a sort of platonic and repressed love. Later they realize that their mates are having an affair, Chow falls in love with Li-Zhen, but her shyness and probably repressed condition of married woman keeps her love in a platonic level. &#39;In the Mood for Love&#39; is a very slow, beautiful, melancholic and romantic love story, with a wonderful photography and soundtrack and a very unusual edition. The film had not had a screenplay, and the actors were never sure about what they would be shooting. Later, the director edited his story based on the footages. When Chow moves to Singapore, there is a gap of many years in the story until 1966, when its conclusion is intentionally open and not well defined, leaving questions such as who is the boy with Li-Zhen. My vote is eight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#39;Amor \xc3\x80 Flor da Pele&#39; (&#39;Love on the Surface of the Skin&#39;)&#34;

b&#39;Although not the most technically advanced film I have seen, this was a fun and enjoyable couple of hours. The main characters are sweet and you really get to like them, and feel something when Susie Q. has to go, but feel good again when she returns as Maggie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lots of stock dialogue, and a contrived plot-line, but most of all, LOTS OF FUN.&#39;

b&#34;Things I like. Steve Zahn as Gus, nails the part, copies Robert Duvalls mannerisms which makes him feel comfortable to Gus fans. (some of the other actors copy their predecessors style in this series as well). Karl Urban, looks grim and tough, but can crack a joke and smile too, which T.L.Jones did in original series. The gear, the guns, the clothing, all accurate, or very close to period accurate. I&#39;ll never forgive Costner and Duvall for having a nylon lariat in their chuckwagon in Open Range. The Comanches, they are actually riding bareback, rather than hiding a modern saddle under a Navajo blanket. And they aren&#39;t painted as politically correct peace loving pastoralists, but as a proud warrior people. There are some dumb scenes, but it beats the heck out of yet another variation on doing something stupid to not win a million dollars reality game shows.&#34;

b&#39;This little film is hysterical, full of stereotypes about gays, straights, dwarfs, British tea and pubs, American gun culture, divorce and marriage; yet, it manages to be sensitive to the issues surrounding each. Kathy Bates is &#34;Amazing&#34; Grace Beasley, and as a character actor of staggering range, she brings her considerable comedic talent to ground this somewhat unusual film as she did in Fried Green Tomatos. With the help of other comedic talents like Dan Akroid as Max, her ex-lawyer husband and the backdrop of downtown Chicago and rural England, the story is just intriguing enough to entertain. Jonathan Price plays Victor Fox, a closet gay singer murdered by a cross-bow killer in Chicago. His valet-lover Dirk Simpson, played by the stunning Rupert Everett, must overcome Victor\&#39;s siblings, including Lynn Redgrave, who want to turn their home into a tribute museum, and teams with Bates and her dwarf daughter-in-law, Maudy Beasley, to find the killer among the homeless of Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The entire cast sing at various points in the pursuit, and are excellent, esp. the talented Price and Bates. This implausible storyline, both funny and bizarre, is one of the most off-center films. Cameos by Julie Andrews, Barry Manlow, and Sally Jesse Raphael should tell you just how bizarre this film truly is. Strange, funny, and off-center but with a good perspective about people with every kind of difference.&#39;

b&#34;Everywhere I hear that people are calling this show bad because its premise is too far fetched....well maybe a do-good cab driver in Philly is pushing it a little (at least the cab drivers ive met), but that&#39;s what makes the show great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that this show is a little off the reality track is an issue but its still enjoyable and fun. Its highly watchable and even though u know Mike wins out in the end he never wins in life. David Morse is a great actor and does a great job in the title role. His supporting cast is great and i must say the location of the show is especially great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I watch this show not because im looking for a good dose of reality or a show with lots of action, I watch this show because its got great acting, a good premise, and a great story-line every week. It&#39;s also a plus when i can pick out the landmarks he drives by, or know what intersection he&#39;s at. I Love this show and I love Philly!! Give this show a shot!&#34;

b&#34;Okay, so this series kind of takes the route of &#39;here we go again!&#39; Week in, week out David Morse&#39;s character helps out his ride who is in a bit of a pickle - but what&#39;s wrong with that!? David Morse is one of the greatest character actors out there, and certainly the coolest, and to have him in a series created by David Koepp - a great writer - is heaven!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lack of love for this show by many, I can&#39;t see it going to a season series - but you never know? The amount of rubbish that has made it beyond that baffles me - let&#39;s hope something good can make it past a first series!!!&#34;

b&#39;Went looking for this movie after i read Tom Clancy\&#39;s &#34;Red Storm Rising&#34; novel. Timeless masterpiece about 13th century Russians being invaded by the Germans. Movie was made in 1938, under orders from Joseph Stalin to warn Soviets about Hitler and Germany. Battle scenes are wonderfully done, showing that you don\&#39;t need computer animation to make a great fight scene. Probably Sergei Eisenstein\&#39;s greatest work. Also see \&#39;Battleship Potemkin\&#39;. Any history buff or poli-sci major should watch this movie. 10 out of 10.&#39;

b&#34;This movie deserved better. Mike Judge&#39;s satirical wit brought to light something too many in this country are trying to deny... we&#39;re getting dumber as a society.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could the 24-hour-a-day Anna Nicole coverage be any more proof? Mike Judge paints a frightening future, where the dumb survive and thrive. Makes you stop and think, and laugh. Can you look at the world and not ask are we getting dumber? Are we being overtaking by the human trash as well as our own trash? (Beware of landslides).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is really funny. I&#39;d tell you more of the plot but I don&#39;t want to spoil it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why release this film with ZERO promotion? Could it be that the stupid are already taking over?&#34;

b&#39;For me, a ten-star film is one that never dies in my memory, and yet can be watched over and over again with the same pleasure as the first time. This could be a technically flawed movie; the pleasure has nothing to do with spit-and-polish (my personal top-ten is idiosyncratic, to say the least!). John Carpenter\&#39;s &#34;The Thing&#34; is one of very few films to fit this criterion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;ve been a science fiction fan since I was a child in the Sixties, and I read the John W Campbell short story on which the film is based (&#34;Who Goes There&#34;) before I saw the original, black-and-white Howard Hawks film (as with a lot of people, that viewing was illicit, on the TV, when I should have been in bed!). That movie, as with so many that you see as a child in such circumstances, seemed near perfection: the suspense, the inexplicable nature of the alien, the photography; it all just seemed to work. I watched it many times in the years after (and still do, when it is shown on TV). Because of this, I avoided the Carpenter version for years - seeing remakes of one\&#39;s favourite film is, I thought, always a mistake. When I did eventually watch it sometime in 1988/9, again on TV because there was nothing else on, I realised that I need to change &#34;always a mistake&#34; to &#34;usually a mistake&#34;! Carpenter had produced something different from the original film, closer to the original story, and truly wonderful. From the opening scene of the helicopter and husky, through the viscerally disturbing scene in the dog-pound, to that ending (sorry, no spoilers here!), I was hooked. The sound track alone lives with me - all I have to hear is a close similarity to that bass-over-snare drum beat, and I\&#39;m *in* the final scene again ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until seeing &#34;The Thing&#34;, I had Carpenter down as just another gore-monkey, based only on comments and reviews in mainstream press. Since seeing &#34;The Thing&#34;, I think I have seen most of his movies - I haven\&#39;t gone out of my to do so, but if one comes up, just seeing his name as director is enough to make up my mind to watch it. He is thoughtful, and knows how to build a film up so that it reaches a point at which something will stick in the memory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven\&#39;t seen &#34;The Thing&#34;, and you enjoy science fiction, do yourself a favour - sit down in a dark room, wrap up warm, and prepare to have your memory enhanced!&#39;

b&#39;I remember a time when the only thing that did exist where clubs, drugs pubs and parties. This movie came out a couple of years after i started going clubbing. If i had never discovered the ravier side of things this movie may not have made sense to me. That night when i watched it for the 1st time, with some mates, i was completely blown away. I had never watched a movie that hit so close to the reality of where i was in my life at that time. Almost everything i could relate to in some way. There was never 1 character i could fully relate to but more a combination of all of them in one way or another. My mates where no different and i remember us all saying that they where us or we where them. We had all been out that weekend together doing exactly what the crew do in HT. We where coming down while we watched and when the movie &#34;came down&#34; i remember actually coming down a bit further. it was actually quite depressing in our room during those &#34;low points&#34;. Thats what\&#39;s so good about Human Traffic. it really taps the whole situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its a unique movie in the way its not plot driven, but then its not completely character driven although the characters are important. it always seemed to be based on the situations. Situations as a group and as individuals. Each character is lost in life, for their own reasons. yet each of them responds to the lostness in the same way. work any job to make money to pay for the weekend and escape it all. for them its their holiday. But the reality is you cant truly escape. Another situation they all have to face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Me and my mates where no different from these guys. We all had our own stuff going on. Human traffic helped explain to us what we didn\&#39;t understand about our selves. It does it in a way that doesn\&#39;t talk down to you. It made us feel like we weren\&#39;t the only ones out there like us and that the lessons learned where ones many others, from all over the world, had gone thru. it wasn\&#39;t until my lifestyle changed from party popper to career driven that i would fully understand this movie. these days i watch HT, every now and then(as i just have), and reminisce the old days. No other movie can do this. I was peter popper, i was jip travolta, i went to never never land with my chosen family. i\&#39;d have $200 in my back burner and i wax the lot! No worries!&#39;

b&#39;There is a bunch of movies that we say must be seen twice. In most cases this is mainly a recommendation: you understand the movie anyway after the first viewing, and watching it for the second time helps you catch the plot twists you just did not notice. However, for Mulholland Dr. this is different. The sequence that worked for me was: see it first time - spend a day in Internet trying to figure out what this was all about - and then see it second time. Otherwise most likely you will not be able to enjoy this film to the full extent. Then you start to understand that this piece is ingenious, camera work is stunning, and the aftertaste follows you for weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9/10&#39;

b&#39;I remember watching this when it was made and thinking it was brilliant at the time. Watching it for the second time nearly 20 years later, I still think Traffik is brilliant and much better than the US film that was based on this drama.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should also be watched by all our come today gone tomorrow politicians who think they can win the war on drugs, as the issues raised in this film are as pertinent today as they were back then at the end of the 80s, and unless they change their policies, will be so in another 20 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well written, well made, beautifully acted and superbly filmed. A thought provoking drama that entertains as well as brings to light some of the hard realities of the criminal drug trade.&#39;

b&#39;I, being a fan of Rupert Grint, rented this film a few months ago. I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors. It was entertaining, and showed that Rupert Grint could play more than his most well known character of Ron Weasley. His subtle portrayal of Ben and everyone else\&#39;s great acting made this film very likable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben, a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother, is looking for a job. He finds one and becomes the, I guess you could call &#34;assistant&#34; to Evie, a retired actress. At first, it is just a way for him to earn some money. But after a while, he and Evie seem to develop a friendship. Evie helps Ben break out of his shell a little and gets him to have fun and be happy with himself, and in the end they both seem to need each other.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you are a fan of Rupert Grint or not, this movie is a really entertaining one with some very cute and moments. I highly recommend it to anybody who wants to see a great movie with great and talented actors.&#39;

b&#39;I watched this movie for the first time around 1990 as a young kid and it scared the Jesus out of me. I loved it so much and I was dying to get my hands on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2002, I remembered that this movie existed but I had no idea what it was called, so, I went to the I Need To Know section on IMDb and explained what the movie was about and tried to get the name of it. Anyway, eventually someone on IMDb told me, so I researched and tried to buy the movie. So eventually i got a hold of it on DVD, and I now keep this movie as one of my most valuable horror movies. I really love it, and I think anyone who watches it, will be very scared in the woods the next time they go. 9/10.&#39;

b&#34;As talk-shows go, Larry King Live is not bad, and since he occasionally gets good guests, it&#39;s a show to turn on once in awhile, but not compulsively. When Bill Maher, Carl Bernstein, a former president, or other substantive guests sit across from him, it&#39;s not too bad. Other times, he tends to host guests involved in the latest celebrity scandal which contributes absolutely no intelligent information to the country and feeds a largely uneducated public that wants to hear the latest gossip about movie and TV stars. During the OJ Simpson trial, it seemed like every other guest on his show was related to the case. But is this really journalism? Or the National Enquirer on the tube? Sometimes, it comes off a little bit like trash television--Jerry Springer in a sit down interview with phone calls instead of a live audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other side, King&#39;s show is definitely much better than Bill O&#39;Reilly whose show is nothing more than a rightest-political platform of the Rush Limbaugh variety. That said, Larry King is not a bad interviewer, but alas, he is not a great one. King does not always come off like he completely comprehends when intellectual material is being presented, especially if it is by a scholar or historian with a new book on subtle aspects of politics. Always seems like the minute King can&#39;t quite deal with the issue at hand, that&#39;s when he turns to the phone calls, maybe hoping someone out in the country will have a better question than he has. He might interview someone like David Gergen, but may not have read any of his books. Sort of like the movie producer that never bothers to read the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it&#39;s an entertainment celebrity, no problem. He can come off like he&#39;s thoroughly knowledgeable since the material is not that substantive anyway. Talking to Elizabeth Taylor about her relationship with Richard Burton is not exactly rocket science. And I notice he usually has seen the star&#39;s latest movie. Watching a movie takes much less time and contemplation than reading a book. However, if it&#39;s the likes of John Dean or Bob Woodward, King comes off a little like he didn&#39;t quite finish his homework. So off to the phones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for real in-depth interviewing, Terry Gross of NPR is probably the best interviewer in the United States. She reads and/or researches everything written by or about her guests beforehand and has a working knowledge of those areas. I don&#39;t see King quite doing that. Granted, he probably has an audience 1000 times larger than Terry Gross, which may say more about the American audience than King. In short, Larry is better than Bill but not as good as Terry.&#34;

b&#39;In this election year, where so much idealism is attached to one of the candidates, it is poignant to watch a film that warns us not to make an idol out of anyone running for public office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Luke Eberl is the writer and director of &#34;Choose Connor&#34;. There are significant parts of the film that reveal that he is a \&#39;genius\&#39; when it comes to telling stories via the cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go see this movie before the election and then ponder why and for whom you will cast your vote.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let you eyes be opened like those of the young protagonist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mix of &#34;Citizen Kane&#34;, &#34;Advise and Consent&#34; and &#34;Paths of Glory&#34; by a young director as talented as those who made the films listed above.&#39;

b&#39;Dolemite may not have been the first black exploitation flick to come along but it certainly is one of the best. It is a pivotal film in the Black Exploitation genre as where it caused a dramatic shift between the films that came before it in contrast to the films that came after it. It wasn\&#39;t necessarily a poignant or moving film about black culture and it\&#39;s fight to overcome issues like racism or anything as important as that, but it was the story of one bad-assed dude fighting &#34;whitey&#34; with his army of hot kung-fu mama\&#39;s. It was a guilty pleasure, great fun and best to watch it with friends. (10 out of 10)&#39;

b&#34;This nifty little movie demonstrates the rock-solid virtues of a time, place and kind of masculine strength that we no longer have or even aspire to have. The Saint is a paladin with only the best motives, to say nothing of a polished vocabulary and diction. No need to turn up the volume or read the dialog. George Sanders is so charming and, yes, low-key that all that talent, smarts, physical presence and above all, masculinity, seem, well, almost normal. Some normal! George Clooney can not begin to master the scene as Mr. Sanders does (and does without Mr. Clooney&#39;s mugging).He could play a sniveler (witness The Ghost and Mrs. Muir and Rebecca) but when he was good, he was very, very good. Truly, a man for all reasons and seasons.&#34;

b&#34;i was part of the cast of Space Odyssey, playing FIDO in mission control. i just want to say that none of us actors, specially those in mission control who had to react to a green screen most of the time, had any idea how amazing it would turn out to be. i knew it was going to be good, if only for the sheer camaraderie and professionalism that the production team at Impossible Pictures provided for everyone involved. but when we all saw it for the first time at the screening at the Curzon Mayfair, well, i for one felt very proud. I was so glad that none of us looked like we were in Star Trek. Joe Aherne, the screenwriter and director, is the most amazing man to work for. He pretty much gets a good team together and then just trusts them implicitly to freely do what they do best. I&#39;m really lucky to have been part of this show. Who knew something this epic and complicated to understand would turn out to be so enticing to watch. and my god it&#39;s a beautiful universe out there.&#34;

Next up one of the worst wrestlers on the roster - Heidenreich takes on The Undertaker in a boring casket match. Match number 3 sees Bradshaw defend his WWE title against Big Show and Kurt Angle in a surprisingly good contest.

b&#39;&#34;Nuovomondo&#34; was a great experience. Many filmmakers tell their stories to a big extent via dialogue. Emanuele Crialese directs his film very visually driven. For everything he wants to tell, he finds powerful images that are able to stand for themselves. Thus, he understands film as a medium that primarily tells its stories over the pictures on screen. Particularly European cinema is often very dialogue-driven (and many of the young US-American directors are strongly influenced by that). Crialese\&#39;s opposite attitude was really the point, that made this film special for me. It has also a very interesting topic that is wrapped up in a quite unusual story and told with humour. Vincenzo Amato is outstanding as family head Salvatore, as well as the amazing Charlotte Gainsbourg, who I enjoy watching in every single one of her movies. There are many great sequences in this movie. Just to pick one: When the ship leaves Italy and the people just quietly stare. This scene is great, particularly if you consider the pop cultural references that go with it (Titanic!).&#39;

b&#34;so, i won&#39;t disagree with the critics but I really was not all that moved by this movie. i was a little hesitant to rent it,as I am going through some of the same things the protagonist is supposed to be experiencing. yet, i did rent it thinking that I might experience some catharsis, or at the least understand that I am not alone. while i understood the protagonist&#39;s irritation with his careless cousin, I didn&#39;t feel his internal struggle with isolation as much as I would have liked. i felt that much more emphasis was placed on his disruptive cousin overstaying his welcome. it is a beautifully filmed movie, and I did really appreciate the use of silence to bring out the feeling of isolation.&#34;

b&#34;I also saw this at the cinema in the 80s and have never forgotten it, even though I have never seen it again anywhere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know whether if I did see it now it would seem dated, but remembering the storyline and comparing it to some of the terrible modern films I&#39;ve seen on Zone Horror I should think it would stand up very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can still remember his coffin sliding out and opening up and all the dead bodies becoming reanimated, and the blue lightning. Having seen hundreds of horror movies and still remembering this one, it must be good.&#34;

b&#39;Ingmar Bergman\&#39;s meditation on war concerns a couple living an idyllic existence on a small island off the coast (of what country isn\&#39;t specified). Raging off in the distance is a war they know only from news reports. As they go about their day the war comes to them and it soon becomes a struggle for survival as both sides seem not to care about them. Bleak look at the human cost of war and those not readily engaged in battle but caught in the cross fire none the less. Its a movie ahead of its time as some 40 years since it was made the notion of armies at war where most of the casualties are the civilians have come of age. This is a dark disturbing film that is told from the average person\&#39;s point of view with the complete sense of hopeless and confusion best expressed in the thought that kept running through my head, &#34;what do I do now?&#34;. As an intellectual exercise the film is top notch, this is a film that will make you think. As an emotional film it is touching but never fully moving. I was never moved emotionally even as the horror of the situation made my brain do flip flops. (I should state that I admire Bergman intellectually for the ideas that he brings to the table, however I have never been moved by his films. I am not a &#34;fan&#34;. I always sided with Fellini in the old film class argument as to who was better since he had more emotion to his films). Reservations aside this is require viewing especially since we live in a world were war, for most of us, is just a thing on a TV screen.&#39;

b&#39;ccmovieman-1 must be, as the reviewer in the New York Times who preferred the Janis Joplin Big Brother and the Holding Company album to the just released Beatles\&#39;&#34;White&#34; album was called, either evil or insane. National Velvet is a great film. Elizabeth Taylor\&#39;s performance is fantastic, and I fail to discern even a trace of accent, much less too much of one. Her performance is very natural, authentic and unbelievably charming. The rest of the cast is superb, especially Rooney and Revere. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental, I suggest cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straight-forward emotion and human interaction. There was a time when people actually did think and talk in such a manner. Not that this film doesn\&#39;t have a slight hint of the magical permeating through it. That is the reason to tell the story. One might as well criticize the Wizard of Oz, King Kong, The Maltese Falcon, Casablanca, The Black Stallion ( the other great horse film ) or a thousand other films for having action and dialog that seem richer than real life. No my friend, National Velvet endures because of its belief firmly in itself, with tongue firmly not in cheek. Something today\&#39;s jaded filmmakers find nearly impossible to recreate.&#39;

b&#34;This was Bollywood&#39;s answer to Fatal attraction and this is a classic film in its own right. Juhi Chawla was good and so was Sunny Deol but it was Shah Rukh Khan who shot to fame as the stalker. Since then he has become a favourite of the Chopra&#39;s (Dilwale Dulhaniya le Jayenge, Mohhabatein, Dil to pagal hai, Veer Zaara and Chak De India). Shah Rukh at first appears to be a villain but then towards the end you start to sympathize with him. The scripting was superb and the songs were chartbusters. My favourites are Too mere samne and Jaadu teri nazar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the dismal failure of the underrated Lamhe Yash Chopra fought back with Darr. The dialogues were memorable, the k..k..Kiran dialogue is often repeated. Since Darr Yash Chopra has slipped bit. Dil to pagal hai was bad but he redeemed himself slightly with Veer Zaara, which was far far better. This was Yash Chopra&#39;s last masterpiece.&#34;

b&#34;Purportedly made back to back with &#39;Erotic Nights of the Living Dead&#39; with the same cast and setting but for certain this one does not have Laura Gemser. Much derided by all I rather like this movie. Sure enough the storyline and dialogue are codswallop, but this is so beautifully filmed in such a marvellous setting and I actually like the hardcore. I find it at once naturalistic and exotic, and that doesn&#39;t just mean there is a black girl and some limp penises! I find the numerous and varied sex scenes very believable, even if two are set upon a tree trunk at the edge of the ocean with the waves constantly splashing around. The creature does not deign to appear until half hour before the end and is, it has to be said, a disappointment. Still, in the time remaining he manages to kill off all but two of the expedition and in the case of the girls having sex with them first (or afterwards in at least one case!) and this film is not as slow as some maintain. Moreover there are some fine moments of sexploitation, not least the lady scientist and her urge for two &#39;natives&#39;, and the glorious finale when the two survivors speed off in their boat, gaze back at the island they have escaped from, and find there is still time for one last act of copulation.&#34;

b&#39;Although it doesn\&#39;t seem very promising for a long stretch, Renoir\&#39;s French Cancan ends up being an effortlessly charming film. The story is clich\xc3\xa9: a laundry girl, Nini (Fran\xc3\xa7oise Arnoul), is discovered by a night club owner, Danglard (Jean Gabin). Danglard steals her from her baker boyfriend and drops his current girlfriend, both of whom come back for their former lovers. Nini has to choose whether to go back to her humble life with the baker, go on with the show with her employer, oh, or become a princess, as a prince falls in love with her at one point, too. I\&#39;m glad the film didn\&#39;t go for the most obvious choice, as a lesser film certainly would have. The film ends with the opening of Danglard\&#39;s new night club, the Moulin Rouge, and a couple of gorgeous song and dance numbers. The first of them, &#34;Complainte de la Butte,&#34; which also provides the base of most of the film\&#39;s musical score, is simply one of the most gorgeous songs ever written, and Renoir himself wrote it. If you\&#39;re a fan of Baz Luhrmann\&#39;s 2001 film Moulin Rouge!, you\&#39;ll recognize the tune, as it comes up near the beginning of that film, sung by Rufus Wainwright. Although it isn\&#39;t very prominent in that film, everyone I know who owns the soundtrack loves it. In addition to having one of the most lovely songs ever written, French Cancan also boasts one of the cutest leading ladies ever to grace the screen. It\&#39;s hard not to fall head-over-heels in love with that girl. 8/10.&#39;

b&#39;Truly unique and stunning film of Jules Verne\&#39;s &#34;For The Flag&#34; by the Czech master director Karel Zeman.Although the story is enacted in a rather understated late Victorian style, the visuals are a knockout. Zeman uses animation, graphics, painted sets, model animation combined with live action to create the atmosphere of Verne that the reader associates in his mind. The style resembles the steel engravings of Dore and Bennet and Riou that illustrated these stories with a healthy dose of Georges Melies added.Photographed in beautiful black and white the animation is of the highest order and not of a Saturday morning variety. There are underwater sequences where the fishes swimming about are so accurately drawn they can be used in a field guide.There are images of ships ,submarines, flying craft, castles,and machinery that are drawn in such accurate detail that one must have a freeze frame on his VCR or DVD to pause the scene and study the remarkable detail that went into this production.The late Victorian atmosphere is designed to look like this world that never was and delight us in the magic of science that made Verne the great father of the genre. If this is not enough, there also is the film score that probably is one of the best ever created for a fantasy or sci-fi film.Truly a forgotten classic, this one is worth hunting down and buying. Always one of my favorite films of all times, it is sure to be one of yours too. And remember- this was done decades before CGI or computer animation. Kudos to the great artists who obviously put their heart into it. It shows. Jules Verne himself would be proud of this movie.A film that deserves to be better known, but those who have seen it love it-and treasure it. An outstanding achievement , this remarkable film just gets better every time you watch it. A true cinematic work of art from a visionary director.&#39;

b&#34;this flick is strange but i liked it a lot. its about a good girl who loves her bad boy and their messed up honeymoon. he doesn&#39;t love her back and he&#39;s a mean son of a bitch. he starts to love her after some really whacked stuff happens on their honeymoon i wont give it away. its weird yeah!! but different than other movies in a good way i think. i don&#39;t know what to compare it to but its a love story. but has lots of funny stuff too. like get to see James Franco in a wig. i liked the Notebook a lot and it kinda felt like that because of the love story. but the rest is way different. nothing like that. Sienna Miller is really good. i saw this movie at a test screener because i like her a lot and her fashion. i liked her in factory girl but this is a better movie than that was. her and james franco look really in love in this movie and i hope they are together in real life but don&#39;t know&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;see it!!!!&#34;

b&#39;It was AMAZING. As a librarian and an attendee at the New York Library Association\&#39;s Vitality Fund Event on Thursday night, October 18, I was privileged to see a pre-release screening of the new movie, The Kite Runner. The release of the movie has been delayed because of concerns about the welfare of the child actors involved. I am grateful that the NYLA event was allowed to go on as planned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the movie, I feel it was masterfully done. It had as much impact on me, I think, as Stanley Kubrik\&#39;s A Clockwork Orange, even though it is much less graphic - MUCH less. There is no comparison between the horrendous, shocking violence and rape shown in A Clockwork Orange and the small amount of violence actually shown in Kite Runner; only the subject matter and the implications for the human psyche are comparable. (I have written more details about the violence and child rape and how it was handled on my MySpace blog.) My overall impression was that this film was fantastic; one of the best-made films I have seen. The depiction of the Afghani boys flying their kites captured some of the beauty and grace of an art form unknown to most of the world. The subject matter is intensely serious, and the movie carries the emotions of the audience into that subject matter without many jarring &#34;Hollywood touches&#34; which have ruined other movies. Although the overturned cart of pomegranates was an obvious bit of symbolism (to me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I must mention the excellence of the sound track. The recitation by the boy of poetry by Rumi as two main characters are fleeing the country during the Russian invasion - under terrifying circumstances - truly showed the power of those poems. I urge anyone watching to disregard the subtitles in that scene to the extent that you can, and just listen to the beauty of the language. I don\&#39;t even know what language Amir is quoting, whether his normal Dari Persian dialect is the same as Rumi\&#39;s original Persian dialect. Also, please note the sound heard every time a kite line is cut. I found it a profound, distinctive sound, though the librarians who were with me did not notice it at all. I can\&#39;t help but wonder if kites actually make a sound like that when they are &#34;cut&#34;, or if it gives a sense of the vibration/sound experienced by the kite flyer during competition.&#39;

b&#39;Jamie Foxx absolutely IS Ray Charles. His performance is simply genius. He owns the film, just as Spacek owned &#34;Coal Miner\&#39;s Daughter&#34; and Quaid owned &#34;Great Balls of Fire.&#34; In fact, it\&#39;s hard to remember that the part of Ray Charles is being acted, and not played by the man himself. Ray Charles is legendary. He is well-established as a musician and the music is deep, complex, and innovative ~ even more innovative than I realized before watching this movie. The film should make new fans of a young audience who might come into it knowing little about his music. Ray Charles\&#39; life provided excellent biographical material for the film, which goes well beyond being just another movie about a musician. I confess that I knew very little about the man\&#39;s life until I saw this film. I came out of it being impressed with Ray Charles\&#39; courage, strength, and innovation as man and musician.&#39;

b&#34;Why couldn&#39;t the end of the movie have been Sean Connery&#39;s men fighting the French instead of the Germans. Ever since the French had occupied Algeria in 1830, the tribes from Morocco and those of Algeria were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements. This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Rasuadli so his followers would not be raiding Algeria, and then his followers would have attacked the French to free him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans. When the Americans shoot the Germans, their guns (even the pistols) make loud noises, create large bloody bullet wounds, and their enemies are screaming after being shot. When Germans shoot at the Americans, their guns don&#39;t make large sounds, do not create bloody wounds, and their enemies make little or no sound after being shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In real life, the American Krag rifle was the worst rifle America had ever produce until the early version of the M-16 came along. The Krag was hard to maintain, not reliable, and the rifle bolt was always jamming. The German Mauser was one of the world&#39;s finest rifles. We were so impress by it during Spanish American war, that we made a copy of it and call it the Springfield rifle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the people of Morocco must had a word for artillery since the French were using them in their raids against Morocco. I didn&#39;t like it when they made the Rasuldai feel stupid that there was no word for artillery in the Moorican vocabulary. Instead, the Rasuadli stated that the Europeans had guns on wheels that make the ground shake.&#34;

b&#39;This first time writer/director comes across as a season pro with &#34;Two Coyotes&#34;. Most action dramas are all about the action first then the story. But this picture works the other way around. If this is just the beginning for this director, then Hollywood will soon be making room for this rising star. Independent movie making has once again reached a new level.&#39;

b&#39;Very lovely love story between Brenda Blethyn and Alfred Molina. The whole story is very bizarre and funny. An undertaker (A. Molina) loves a married woman (B.Blethyn). They try to fake her death to escape her husband and the village. A scenario of strange situations starts. As good as SAVING GRACE and LONG LIVE NED DEVINE.&#39;

b&#34;A beautiful film about the coming of early silent cinema to China. SHADOW MAGIC deftly combines a love story with the drama of the cultural clash between China&#39;s ancient traditions and modern Western culture in the form of film. An amazing first film by Chinese director Ann Hu. If I correctly understood Ms. Hu&#39;s comments at the 2000 Sundance festival, this film was produced as an American film with co-funding by the Chinese government, and shot in China. SHADOW MAGIC reminds me of films like IL POSTINO and CINEMA PARADISO - not necessarily in theme or plot, but it has a similar feel.&#34;

b&#39;This film easily rivals the emotional strength, the dramatic impact and the top-notch performances of &#34;12 Angry Men&#34;. I rented it on a whim and was amazed that I had not heard of it before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if this was Emilio Estevez\&#39;s directorial debut, but the pacing, the interplay and development of the characters as well as the some clever camera work surrounding the character Estevez plays all suggest a natural eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interplay between Martin and Emilio contains the same wonderful chemistry we saw in Wall Street with Martin and Charlie. Kathy Bates is wonderful in her characters subtle desperation and escapism; a variation on her characters in &#34;At Play In The Fields Of The Lord&#34;. She is irritating and yet one can empathize with her at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some moments where I feel the plot slows a touch and the moments between Estevez and his ex-girlfriend almost seem written for another film, Estevez comes off as another character all together. But those are minor complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film must be based on a true story or must have been written by someone who lived these experiences. I rate it 8 out of a difficult 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;

b&#39;This is a cherished movie from my childhood!! I can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat!! I remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father, usually two to three times a year. We always referred to it as &#34;Giant Robot&#34;. Although the effects in this movie are crude compared to today\&#39;s standards, they were perfect for this movie\&#39;s genre. I am also a BIG fan of the Japanese &#34;Monster&#34; movies, so this movie fell right in to place with the others. It\&#39;s been years since I\&#39;ve seen this movie &amp; would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter.&#39;

b&#34;I truly enjoyed this film. It&#39;s rare to find a star who can pull off the physical aspects of any sports/dance themed film convincingly and do a first rate acting job as well. In this film you find two stars who rise to the occasion. Both women deliver warm, touching and at times humorous performances. The film also touched on a number of topics, from racial issues to sexual identity. And yet the approach wasn&#39;t heavy handed. The production values were also top notch for a small budget film. I saw this at the Philadelphia Gay &amp; Lesbian film festival and went back to see it a second time. It was a real crowd pleaser. Everyone I spoke to seemed to enjoy this film.&#34;

b&#39;Fred was such a great show.It was simple but somehow very addicting.I can still remember the days when I\&#39;d watch this on Kids WB Saturdays ,but then Kids WB did the unforgivable.Kids WB became like that older relative that tries to act &#34;hip&#34; and &#34;funky fresh&#34;.*shudder*They became like that relative who tries to act all cool ,but the attempt is a cheesy disaster.They pulled Coconut Fred\&#39;s Fruit Salad Inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows I\&#39;ve ever seen In my life(Johnny Test).The only thing that keeps me watching KWB anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kids.It was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the schedule.This brings me back to my first point... BRING IT BACK!!!&#39;

b&#34;This movie has a very deep look at the relationships between a mother who was raised in a Christian environment and learned that appearance is everything. She and her son, who just recently returned from Vietnam collide in some very tense issues. The relationship has no connections intimately and is a great accurate portrayal of what it is like to live with someone who is false and only looks at the surface of issues. Kathy Bates does an excellent job of portraying a woman of false faith who is either oblivious to her cruelty, forgetful or just doesn&#39;t want to be confronted. Jeremy&#39;s wrath is never feared and it leads to a very disturbing conflict between him and his feelings about his fathers love for him. This is a very honest look at some family dynamics after a traumatic event leads one to despair.&#34;

b&#39;I loved the movie. I loved Timothy Dalton and Joanne Whaley. The movie had many different locations in it. I really liked when Ann Hampton realized she could not make Rhett love her. And when Scarlett and Ann where together and Ann apologizes for taking Rhett and Scarlett just told her not to worry she would get him back. It had a great story it told. You just can not compare it to GWTW. It just has so many great scenes. I love both SCARLETT AND GWTW! Of course do not forget to have a hankie handy.&#39;

b&#34;This story about a man&#39;s 28 year struggle for a death that would liberate him from his already dead body becomes a masterpiece to be remembered,thanks to a team of artists in a state of grace. Directed, written,edited and scored by Alejandro Amenabar, it touches you from the very first images, and doesn&#39;t leave your eyes and your heart to rest until the last credits, thanks to Alejandro and a group of wonderful actors and actresses at their best. Bardem is an acting animal:One of those few comedians that can make a masterpiece from almost any character, the supporting actresses are great in their roles and the story is told with such a sensibility that one laughs and cries in the same minute, as we used to do with the great old masterpieces. The year&#39;s best film in all senses. 10 / 10&#34;

b&#39;&#34;House of Dracula&#34; is a good sequel to &#34;House of Frankenstein&#34;. There isn\&#39;t as much action but the acting is just as good. Onslow Stevens is the benevolent Doctor who turns bad after receiving blood from Dracula via a transfusion(Dracula was actually receiving the transfusion to overcome his &#34;affliction&#34; but he puts a spell on a hunchback nurse and then transfuses his blood into the Doctor.). It turns out that Dracula really didn\&#39;t come to seek a cure but instead drain blood from a beautiful nurse. Dracula is destroyed and the Wolf Man is next in line for a cure(which is successful). In the meantime, Frankenstein\&#39;s monster is discovered and revived briefly before burning to death(don\&#39;t worry, the same trio came back in &#34;Abbott and Costello meet Frankenstein&#34;). John Carradine again plays a sinister Dracula(Baron Latos is his alias at the start of the film and in &#34;House of Frankenstein&#34;). Lon Chaney is the sympathetic Wolf Man and Glenn Strange returns as the Frankenstein monster. Lionel Atwill again plays an inspector, which he often does in the Universal Studios monster films. A keeper for your collection.&#39;

b&#34;since the plot like Vertigo or Brian DePalma&#39;s Obsession, till to the score by Peter Chase that reminds the sounds of Bernard Herrmann, this little pearl seems to be sight from fews. Remarkable playing by Romane Boeringer and Vincent Cassel in a bohemian Paris portrayed from the famous Thierry Arbogast. A little cult! It is a pity that the only version available on DVD are the french one and the English. Directed by a controversial artist as Gilles Mimouni, it could be considered a little homage to the Cinema masterworks. It is a french movie, and as all of them, not for all, we could say a d&#39;essai cinema. Even if not so publicized, it could be remembered for several reason.&#34;

b&#39;This is an awesome movie, and if you haven\&#39;t seen it, you should go to the video store right now and rent it. First off, the cast is superb. Not only does it have current stars, like Ryan Philippe and Billy Bob Thornton, but it also has your stars of yesteryear like Judge Reinhold. It also has numerous cameos by actors like Jon Bon Jovi, Ted Danson, and Jamie Lee Curtis. Second off, the story was quite good also. It was interesting how they took a plot for a stoner movie, and almost made it dramatic. It takes the drug situation in the United States, and instead of giving it a comedic face like in &#34;Half Baked&#34; it has a true, life lesson image like &#34;Traffic&#34;. So watch this movie, if you\&#39;re a stoner it will give you insight into something you love, if you don\&#39;t do drugs it will give you a more realistic view of drugs than either side wants you to see.&#39;

b&#39;As a kid I loved the song &#34;Never smile at a crocodile&#34;, and if I found myself in this state of affairs, which is actually inspired by true events. Smiling would be the last thing on my mind. From the opening set-up, I\&#39;ve never been so entrenched, caught up and finally exhausted like I was when watching this limited budget Independent Australian horror film, about three people in Northern Territory trapped in a mangrove swamp with a very conniving crocodile waiting in the water below them. What really brought the film alive, was how realistic it managed to be in transporting the fear and uncertainty of the characters\&#39; situation to the audience. Semi-documentary camera-work with a disquietingly eerie backdrop and authentic performances effectively take you out of your comfort zone. What we get is a patient survival tale than just a bloody, all-out creature feature onslaught. Think of &#34;Open Water (2003)&#34;, where its budget and time restraint made sure it would stay low-key, but this minimal barrier enhanced the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The slow-grinding story might be black and white, but it never seemed to become disposable, or succumb to formulaic patterns. Well not largely, and the connection between the characters were emotionally engaging even with a bare, straight-forward script. Although you can say &#34;less is more&#34;, with the actions and expressions illuminating the lingering thoughts plaguing their minds. The ordeal is utterly terrifying, because the threat is very alive and never seems to loosen up. This is what drives the film\&#39;s chaotic adrenaline, and in which it lasts (even when its kept buried) through to the very end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writers / Directors Andrew Traucki and David Nerlich\&#39;s economical guidance alienates and smartly strings along the viewer with its taut pacing and harrowing psychological traits. In certain patches the notch goes up, with pressure induced suspense and startling images. The way the night sequence is executed is immensely chilling and pulsating. The menacing crocodile manipulative toys with its fresh-meat in a distressingly suspenseful approach. Sure some moments felt unlikely, but never does it get in the way or distract. Sound FX is the key, and at times the lack of any just eats away at you. Rafeal May\&#39;s musical score is unassuming and doesn\&#39;t really enter the mixture much, but when it does it builds an organic sounding quality. The cinematography of John Biggins is beautifully devised, and rapidly aggressive when the mood changes. It was always on the move and claustrophobic, but none of this jerky movements. The editing was sharply handled, and the effects were professionally catered by superbly combing live crocodile footage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something like this production would also have to rely on its cast to sell to the story in a believable manner and they do it. Diana Glenn, Andy Rodoreda and especially Maeve Dermody are persuasively good. A lot of the responsibility falls on Dermody, and she strongly delivers with an inspired turn. Now this item might cop some comparisons with another killer crocodile film &#34;Rogue (2007)&#34;, but the two couldn\&#39;t be any different in what they want to be and how they end up. If I had to pick though, I\&#39;m leaning more towards this outing for its sheer involvement to snap at you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A remarkable effort on all fronts, with everyone involved showing potential to really look out for.&#39;

b&#39;Spending an hour seeing this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his &#34;Dan Band&#34; perform their special on Bravo is the most enjoyable hour I\&#39;ve ever spent watching TV. This young man (Dan) is such an incredible talent, as a singer, performer and even dancer. He can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs, all of which have only been sung by women, to hip-hop, rock, also songs written for women.. This guy can do anything. I\&#39;ve seen him live at least 11 times, so I was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format, but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of Dan\&#39;s overwhelming star quality.Do yourself a favor and watch this, or better yet, buy it.&#39;

b&#39;What a movie! I have always liked the Asian style of shooting, and this movie does not disappoint at all! Photography is breath-taking, ranging from amazing landscapes to whirls of colours. The main actor is really realistic in representing the painter (whose paintings are astonishing). The ending is also very well chosen, very poetic. The only remark is that they should have maybe shown a bit more deeply the connection between his inspiration and his abuse of alcohol and women. But altogether this is an excellent film!&#39;

b&#39;This version did not move me as deeply as the later, Hollywood version starring Anthony Hopkins and Debra Winger. While it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted, the BBC version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which I found fascinating. It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual, theological and moral considerations that motivated C. S. Lewis. It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version, but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting. Still, while I did not leave a heaping mound of sodden Kleenex in the theater, I did use one, and at frequent intervals. I enjoyed this film every bit as much as the Hollywood version, and was grateful for the increased understanding I gained.&#39;

b&#39;Though it hardly compares to other sci-fi film giants like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY or CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE THIRD KIND, LIFEFORCE does work as a totally berserk and bizarre melding of science fiction and horror elements. Somehow, despite dialogue that approaches the ridiculous and acting that does the same, it manages to work because of a few highly different elements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Loosely based on Colin Wilson\&#39;s 1976 novel &#34;The Space Vampires&#34;, this film from director Tobe Hooper (POLTERGEIST; THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE) focuses on a joint US-British mission aboard the British space shuttle Churchill to study Halley\&#39;s Comet. Led by an American commander (Steve Railsback), they discover an alien spacecraft in the comet\&#39;s coma. And when they investigate the interior of the spacecraft, they find alien occupants that look like giant bats. Later on, the Churchill reaches Earth\&#39;s orbit, but no response is given from radio calls issued from the mission\&#39;s home base, the Space Research Center in London. Columbia is launched to rendezvous with Churchill, but they find the entire ship gutted by fire--all except for the alien beings encased in glass who, far from being untouched by the fire, look absolutely perfect. The aliens are bought back to Earth...and that\&#39;s where the incredible happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These space vampires escape from the Space Research Center and, instead of draining their victims of blood via bite wounds, suck their victims\&#39; lifeforce totally out of them. One of them is the Space Girl, a thoroughly nude vampiress played by Mathilda May. Railsback, the only actual survivor from Churchill, is bought in by the SRC\&#39;s chief (Frank Finlay) and a British special agent (Peter Firth) to track May, who is in telepathic contact with him. Pretty soon, however, the vampires have turned London into a scene of pure holocaust; people are either being dessicated or turning into zombies, and the threat by NATO to sterilize the city with thermonuclear radiation looms large. Railsback finally catches up with May, and sacrifices himself by impaling her with a large metal sabre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undoubtedly disjointed, unquestionably uneven, but nevertheless worth watching, LIFEFORCE, despite the frequent incoherency of its script and its acting, benefits from some drop-dead excellent special effects work by John Dykstra (STAR WARS), some of the best ever seen. The other working element, and a surprise one it is, is the incredible orchestral score by Henry Mancini, almost Wagnerian in the same way John Williams\&#39; score for STAR WARS was--and Mancini, like Williams before him, uses the London Symphony Orchestra, to boot!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Largely forgotten these days, and a critical and box office disaster in 1985, LIFEFORCE, if for no other reason, should still be seen for anyone with a taste for the bizarre. There had never been a film quite like it before, and there will certainly not be anything like it again.&#39;

b&#34;This is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is. What IS shown is the incredible poverty in Sicily as the 19th century gave way to the 20th, a life style that made people dream of the &#39;New&#39; World of America. The Mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet, just a stone cottage set amid the harsh, unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass. An opening sequence sees the Mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside, stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for a &#39;sign&#39; that they should set out for the New World or remain where they are. It further shows life aboard the liner, huddled masses indeed, yearning to breathe free, and conditions in Ellis Island where, their journey still not over, they are interrogated and examined to prove their &#39;fitness&#39; to enter America. What is NOT shown is the ship in Longshot, or indeed ANY shot that would identify it as a large, ocean-going liner; what is also not shown is anything that would identify America, no clich\xc3\xa9 view of New York Harbour and the Statue of Liberty, so that Ellis Island could be anywhere in any country. Perhaps the most remarkable shot is the one from a Camera Crane looking down on hundreds of people jammed together; slowly, almost imperceptibly two thirds of the people at Screen Left begin to separate from the third at Screen Right and we realize that those on the left are actually aboard the ship and those on the right are on the dock, a powerful statement of society being fragmented. There&#39;s a strong documentary feel throughout as though we were following an actual ship full of immigrants even though it has been carefully scripted and is clearly an amalgam of typical families/conditions at the time. With almost nothing happening in dramatic terms it&#39;s not for the popcorn brigade at the Multiplex but for the rest of us it&#39;s a very fine film indeed.&#34;

b&#39;I say remember where and when you saw this show because I believe if Fox gives Talk Show a chance Spike will be right up there with Conan in a few years because like Conan he is incredibly funny and seems to be just grateful at having his own show which adds to the humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funniest bits Spike has had so far are The Idiot Paparatzi and Comedy For Stoners and if your not high and get CFS what does that say about you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary this show is funnier in 25 minutes than SNL in an hour so lets hope Talk Show gets the attention it deserves such as an extra half hour, more money and a band.&#39;

b&#39;Alice enters in a world of wonder... but not the kind of wonder that you remember as a kid. The Mad Hatter, the White Rabbit, the Queen and others (even Tweedledee and Tweedledum) show Alice some things about her body -- and other people\&#39;s bodies -- that might be quite wonderful. A tale of love and lust the likes you\&#39;ve never seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristine DeBell appears as Alice. I must say, by 1970s standards, this may be the most attractive adult actress of her day. I believe this is her only film before moving on to mainstream work, but it was pretty much the best possible one she could have chosen (my love for all things Alice is no secret). Even better than &#34;Fairy Tales&#34; (which isn\&#39;t really pornography, so, much).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs are cheesy, but fit the theme of the movie. One song, &#34;What\&#39;s a Girl Like You Doing on a Knight Like This?&#34; was pretty funny, and the others had similar themes going. The trial towards the end was well scripted, and fit very nicely into the world of Alice. The logic and humor were definitely accounted for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What more can you say about a film like this? All I know is, for people who are used to adult films where it\&#39;s just a 30-second lead-in to the sex, this one is going to overload you with plot and music. But, personally, I think there\&#39;s something very special about this film and I hope it gets a nice DVD release with things touched up and special features (if that\&#39;s even possible). I can see this being a cult film.&#39;

b&#34;I Loved this movie. Mark Blankfield was perfect for this role. More Classic sci/fie/Horror films should be remade to this comedy level, which is at the very top of the line in my opinion. A no drink movie, you laugh so hard you will spill it all over yourself. Can We expect more? Let&#39;s hope so. I would like to suggest many movies for this type of remake. Mel Brookes made some remakes of classic films.He made some very strong contributions. A Picture of Dorian Gray would be a good suggestion. I hope some producer or director can get into the idea and bring us new comedy to our screens. we are needing a good insurgence of comedy to keep our level of laughter higher than ever before. A good Comedy FIX.&#34;

b&#34;This is one of my favourite films; a delightful comedy; so I was thrilled to learn it is about to be released on DVD in the UK, September 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Romuald, played by Daniel Auteuil is a rich company president of a dairy firm. Juliette, played by the excellent Firmine Richard, is a cleaner of the company&#39;s Paris offices.Juliette, a black mother of several children, discovers a plot against Romuald who initially ignores her attempts to warn him. Slowly he grasps what this charming lady from the Parisian underclass has been trying to tell him. &#39;he seeks shelter in her crowded apartment as his marriage and career fall apart. An unlikely love blossoms. Cultures clash in what is a truly delightful light-hearted comedy.&#34;

b&#39;If I\&#39;d only seen the poster for Nurse Betty, I probably wouldn\&#39;t have touched it with a ten-foot pole. But after I heard some positive buzz, and knowing it made some noise at Cannes, I decided to give it a try. What I got is a truly enjoyable movie, based on a very entertaining plot. Rene Zelleweger is impressive in her role as \xc2\x91nurse\&#39; Betty, a woman who is sent into a delusional psychotic episode following a traumatic experience. I also liked Morgan Freeman (no surprise) and was pleasantly surprised by foul-mouthed comedian Chris Rock. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film bounces continuously between comedy, drama, romance, and thriller. Yet despite this apparent identity crisis, it holds up quite well. I found my eyes glued to the screen from beginning to end always waiting for the next twist in the story. The entire cast is strong, if not spectacular. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only real complaint is that director Neil Labute (who made a splash a few years ago with the very impressive and dark \xc2\x91In the Company of Men\&#39;) relied much too heavily on many cliched Hollywood conventions. The mood-creating musical effects he crammed down our throats during each sentimental scene were unbearable! And he did the standard old &#34;let\&#39;s take some of the minor characters and pair them up at the end in an illogical and unnecessary romance&#34; trick, just to make absolutely certain everyone goes home with a smile on their face. Why must directors and writers treat their audiences like idiots??&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the movie is still much too enjoyable to be dragged down very far by these annoying irritations. In a very subpar year for movies, \&#39;Nurse Betty\&#39; ranks as one of the more pleasant surprises of 2000. 8 out of 10.&#39;

b&#39;I saw the movie at the Nashville film festival on May 1, 2003! It was amazing! All the things that I had read about Stuey were portrayed incredibly well by Tony Vidmer (writer, director, producer, editor), Michael Imperioli (incredible job as Stuey), and all the others involved in this. I\&#39;m glad he (Vidmer) didn\&#39;t go down the &#34;Leaving Las Vegas&#34; routine with Stuey\&#39;s bad habits, but instead put us inside his life, family, and his gift. Tying the whole story from the motel room where he died was a great vehicle and showed his screenwriting skill. A big &#34;thumbs up&#34; on this one!&#39;

b&#34;This is a new Barbie movie. The graphics were really good. They made the movie seem partially realistic. I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it. This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different. A father of 12 princesses gets very sick. His cousin poisons him and wants the throne. The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mother&#39;s stories. Its up to them to save their father and society. With the help of their handsome prince. It was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it. We enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot. The music was very nice and made the movie even greater. It had a great classical orchestra. The voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute. I liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family. All in all I&#39;d watch it again.&#34;

b&#39;Married To The Mob was one of the first VHS tapes that I had along with Coming To America and Grease. I still have fond memories of this film after all these years. Hell, I still have the VHS of this film in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story: Undercover cop Mike Downey(Matthew Modine)is sent to spy on Angela De Marco(Michelle Pfeiffer) the wife of the slain mafia member Frank &#34;Cucumber&#34; De Marco(Alec Baldwin). He later falls in love with her after he realizes that she is innocent in all this. Angela not only has to deal with the unwanted advances of mob boss Tony &#34;The Tiger&#34; Russo(Dean Stockwell), she also has to deal with his jealous wife Connie Russo(Mercedes Ruehl).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Married To The Mob is funny and still keeps your interest when its not trying to be funny. I like the little jabs it takes at mafia life(the jealous mafia wife, the mob boss that doesn\&#39;t realize that he is not a chick magnet etc) and you like the characters of Angela De Marco and Mike Downey. It was the last of the funny phase of Johnathan Demme before he got serious and gave you gems like Philadelphia and Silence Of The Lambs(best thriller of all time). If you\&#39;re in the mood for comedy, Married To The Mob is a keeper. Its better than the rubbish that passes for comedy nowadays(Epic Movie, Date Movie, Meet The Spartans, Disaster Movie etc).&#39;

b&#39;This was a very faithful presentation of Lewis\&#39;s life in the mid-50\&#39;s. The dialogue on theology and the banter with his follow colleagues was exceptionally good. Michael White\&#39;s book, &#34;C.S. Lewis: Creator of Narnia&#34; deals with this time frame in a very parallel way. Joss Ackland\&#39;s acting was superb in catching the unemotional Lewis. The movie took great pains to be presented in an accurate English setting. The development of a strong bond between &#34;Jack&#34; (his preferred name) Lewis and Douglas Gresham, Joy\&#39;s son from her previous marriage, was enjoyable to watch. The movie did avoid the distasteful element of &#34;Warnie&#34; Lewis\&#39;s (Jack\&#39;s older brother) drinking problem, but it would not have moved the story on, so it is best left out.&#39;

b&#39;The impossibly sexy Rosie Holotik plays Charlotte Beale, a new nurse at one of those movie-type asylums where the doctor in charge has his own, unorthodox ways of treating the inmates. Reluctantly bringing her on board is the officious Dr. Masters (Anne MacAdams, a.k.a. Annabelle Weenick). The inmates don\&#39;t take too kindly to Charlotte, either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Part mystery, part horror, this initial effort from B-movie director S.F. Brownrigg has an oppressive feel to it. These colorful psychos, including a nymphomaniac with no self-esteem, a gentle giant who\&#39;s already had a lobotomy, and a supposed &#34;judge&#34; who speaks in legalese jargon, dominate the screen with their unnerving presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a picture that works fairly well, establishing the gritty, grim atmosphere right from the get go. Some brief bursts of graphic violence also help to give it that good old fashioned exploitative quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It builds in intensity as the imperiled heroine struggles to maintain her own sanity, offering one surreal encounter after another. Particularly effective is the poetry-quoting, dotty old Mrs. Callingham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For cheap 1970\&#39;s era cheese, it\&#39;s pretty effective, with a particularly nasty climax. I had a pretty good time watching it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7/10&#39;

b&#34;Film certainly can be a narrative medium, but by no means is it the ideal medium. Literature best carries a plot, because the reader can supply the imagination necessary to complete the structure. Film is appreciated best when viewed for what it is: a series of images grouped together. What Soderbergh does in Ocean&#39;s Twelve is combine impeccable film-making technique with the free-flowing form of American movies from the 1970s. From looking at the comments posted recently, most people went in expecting a standard-issue heist movie, a la Entrapment; it seems people actually miss the tiresome clich\xc3\xa9s of romance disguised as tension between the leads and ridiculous plot twists designed to keep the audience awake. Soderbergh&#39;s directing prowess is reason alone to see this movie, but close-ups of Pitt and Zeta-Jones forty feet high on the screen don&#39;t hurt either. A true treat for those who love the flickering of lights on the silver screen, and a disappointment for those trying to make film something it&#39;s not.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Porgy and Bess&#34; is an outstanding production of George Gershwin\&#39;s masterpiece. It is tastefully done in muted colors. The voices are outstanding. Although Sidney Portier\&#39;s voice is dubbed for his singing portion, he gives a very touching performance. There is a remarkable performance by Sammy Davis Jr. as Sportin Life. There is yet no DVD available for viewing, and this piece begs for one. All intelligent movie goers who enjoyed it in 1959 will appreciate the release of this masterpiece on the new medium. The screen is filled with a dynamic presentation that rivals all other musicals including the outstanding ones by Rodgers and Hammerstein. Be sure to ask for it an your video supplier. Like &#34;Songs of the South&#34; by Walt Disney, it may be the assumption of racial overtones that is preventing the marketing of this cinema.&#39;

b&#39;I remember seeing this 1978 comedy at one of the bargain matinees I took in when I was looking for a study break from my college courses. Walter Matthau and Glenda Jackson do some effective Tracy-Hepburn-style thrusting-and-parrying in this featherweight romp directed by the reliable Howard Zieff (he did &#34;Private Benjamin&#34;) about a newly widowed doctor\&#39;s aggressive re-entry into the dating game. It all breezes by quickly primarily thanks to the clever script by veteran screenwriter Julius J. Epstein (&#34;Casablanca&#34;) along with Alan Mandel, Max Shulman and future director Charles Shyer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dr. Charley Nichols has just come back from Hawaii after his wife\&#39;s death. Upon his return, he becomes aware that he is instant catnip to any and all the single women in LA. He works in a hospital run by an increasingly senile chief-of-staff, Amos Willoughby, whom Charley has to pacify to keep his residency. Enter Ann Atkinson, a transplanted Englishwoman who bakes cheesecakes for a living and has certain concrete opinions about the medical profession, which she expresses freely on a PBS talk show. Of course, Charley is on the show\&#39;s discussion panel, and sparks, as they say, fly. This leads to the standard complications about how serious Charley is willing to become about Ann. At the same time, the hospital has to deal with a potential wrongful death lawsuit from the widow of a rich baseball team owner who died at the hospital under Willoughby\&#39;s careless supervision.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s just refreshing to see such a mature yet bracing love story between two characters inhabited by actors who deliver lines with the scalpel-wielding skill of surgeons. Matthau is his usual 1970\&#39;s curmudgeonly swinger and quite a sight waddling with his gangly arms held akimbo in his power walk. Away from her heavy, award-winning Elizabethan roles, Jackson is crisply sardonic and charmingly vulnerable as the feisty Ann, who thinks all doctors should aspire to be Albert Schweitzer. Art Carney plays Willoughby with predictable bluster, while Richard Benjamin provides amiable support as Charley\&#39;s colleague, Dr. Solomon. It\&#39;s all very compact with a few nice jabs at the greed within the medical profession. There are no extras on the 2005 DVD.&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Tourist Trap&#34; is among my favorite late 70\&#39;s/early 80\&#39;s horror flicks. A group of young people are heading somewhere, one pair in the car ahead, &amp; that car has a flat, and our film opens with the young man, Woody, pushing the tire along looking for a service station. He finds a seemingly abandoned place, and yet hears voices and investigates, and ends up with a piece of pipe through his stomach for his efforts. Along comes the rest of the young folks (in a VW Thing) and they pick up Woody\&#39;s girlfriend, and find this very same place, Slausen\&#39;s Oasis, or some such thing..and then Mr. Slausen happens along while the girls are enjoying a dip in the stream. Of course, the VW Thing has mysteriously died at that point, so odd Mr. Slausen (Chuck Connors) offers his help. Mr. Slausen has a museum, with lots of wax figures, and he lives in the museum but behind is a big house, where he says Davey lives. And who is Davey? Why, Davey Crockett, he says...but if it were Davey Crockett, they\&#39;d all probably be safer. The girls are left alone while Slausen goes to help with fixing the car, but of course curiosity gets the better of one &amp; she goes to investigate, and finds the house full of creepy mannequins and one rather animated one named...Davey. What follows is a rather creepy night of terror as one by one, they\&#39;re taken prisoner by Davey, who says he\&#39;s Slausen\&#39;s brother. One girl (kidnapped earlier) is treated to a plaster facial, which results in her death when it covers up her air supply. At any rate there\&#39;s somewhat of a twist to this and kind (but weird) Mr. Slausen is not exactly what he appears to be. A good, creepy late 70\&#39;s horror flick, and lots of mannequins make for a very creepy atmosphere. 7 out of 10.&#39;

b&#34;Yeah great cult TV series. Great atmosphere, top script and good performances make this a class A candidate for DVD release. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a seminal tour de force of Australian TV history and has that unforgettable groovy period piece soundtrack with Doug Parkinson&#39;s gravel and phlegm voice spewing 70&#39;s Australiana all over your cathode ray box as a amazingly long camera zoom out reveals the religion of the open road in all its Antipodean glory. This is a memento from another and not too distant era, and has the proud stamp of the land mighty Down Under from start to finish in all its raw freedom and gritty grandeur. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on ABC! Get with the program and release this cool 70&#39;s cult baby for all to enjoy - or re-enjoy if you&#39;re lucky enough to have lived the dream at the time.&#34;

b&#39;I just wanted to say that I am watching National Velvet on TV, it is now Feb 2006 and I was checking on dates details, etc. Surprising to see it was made in 1944 and Rooney was 24 years old whilst Liz Taylor only 12, what an accomplished English actress she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To put some Americans contributors right: There are no Irish villages in England. Ireland is a completely different country and has nothing whatsoever to do with the English countryside. The scenes shown are supposedly taken on the South coast of England between Brighton and Arundel (county of Sussex). No such scene exists now unfortunately. Like many other places roads and buildings have been built on the hills and beaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So please, all you lovely Americans, do not confuse Ireland with England, ever! we take great exception to it. Like confusing Texas with Coney Island.&#39;

b&#39;Though, short lived &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; was one of the best made for TV versions of a famed comic book hero. Only &#34;Wonder Woman&#34; (Lynda Carter) (the best of the genre and &#34;The Incredible Hulk&#34; (Bill Bixby, Lou Ferrigno) were better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; outclasses the 1966-1968 &#34;Batman&#34;, because the high camp elements of the latter often ruin the adventure. &#34;Spider-Man&#34; outclasses all three television interpretations of &#34;Superman&#34;- &#34;Lois and Clark&#34;, &#34;Smallville&#34;, and of course the George Reeves &#34;Superman&#34; which brings up the rear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Amazing Spider-Man&#34; was an action drama, during the late 1970\&#39;s, the pre-CGI era, when stunts had to be performed by stunt men, not in the database of a computer. &#34;Spider-Man&#34; had its own very talented stuntman to perform the death defying daredevil acrobatics. His name was Fred Waugh, who donned the spidy suit for the action sequences. Nicholas Hammond, better known as one of Julie Andrew\&#39;s children on the all-time movie classic &#34;The Sound of Music&#34; was Spider-Man during the dialogue scenes. Hammond\&#39;s Spider-Man also had his own secret identity as Peter Parker, similar to Christopher Reeve- Superman/ Clark Kent, Adam West-Batman/Bruce Wayne, and of course Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman/ Diana Prince.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s unfortunate that the series only had thirteen episodes. Because when the first episode hit the airwaves in November of 1977, the entire country was watching it on CBS that Wednesday night. In all fairness, CBS should release this pilot episode as well as &#34;The Deadly Dust&#34;, the &#34;Captive Tower&#34; etc. on DVD shortly. &#34;Spider-Man&#34; was short lived, but did have a cult following, and in my opinion was a heck of a lot better than the movie interpretation of the famed comic book hero starring Toby McGuire.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CBS might be hesitant to release these episodes for two reasons. (A) There might not be a broad market for them based on the lack of longevity of the series and a generation of children and young people who weren\&#39;t born when the series originally aired in the 1970\&#39;s. (B) One of the early &#34;Spider-Man&#34; episodes dealt with a terrorist with designs on the World Trade Center, which was attacked twice many years after this show went off the air, in 1993, and of course the devastating attack against this country on 9/11/01 in which the towers were destroyed and many innocent lives were lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However I don\&#39;t think that it would be in bad taste to release this &#34;Spider-Man&#34; episode even if the show was adventure, derived from a comic book, and camp in nature. The live action &#34;Amazing Spider-Man&#34; doesn\&#39;t have a large following but it has a cult following. If and when CBS releases it out on DVD this cult following could be explained along with the episode in which Spiderman saved the towers in 1978, but how in September of 2001 real life proved to be different from the movies. I like to follow the news, but I also like Science Fiction/Fantasy. Therefore I am eagerly awaiting the release of &#34;The Amazing Spider-Man on DVD&#34;.&#39;

b&#34;A couple of years before SCREAM spoofed the slasher/horror genre with savvy, self-conscious young things knowing every trick in the book of what to do and not to do in a precarious situation, a little movie produced in Russia hit the theatres without any grandiose pretensions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie was MUTE WITNESS. Starring a cast of unknowns (except an extremely brief cameo by Sir Alec Guiness whose scenes were purportedly filmed eight years prior to the actual filming of this movie), it told the story of a mute make-up artist, Billie, who is working on a film on location in Russia produced and directed by her sister&#39;s boyfriend Andy. She is unaware that the set has closed when she goes to retrieve her belongings and inadvertently stumbles onto a porn shoot that becomes extremely bloody. Overcome with horror she alerts the murderers of her presence, a chase ensues, and finally she is rescued by Andy who take her home as they alert the police. The trouble is... there is no body, no evidence that anything of the sort took place. Even so, a mysterious inspector seems to be on Billie&#39;s side of the story....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to say more would be criminal. MUTE WITNESS is the kind of film that demands a scrutiny of viewing similar to the most intricate, clever thriller because as much as it is a convoluted thriller, it&#39;s one that pays its dues to movies like WAIT UNTIL DARK and the best of Hitchcock in its choice of camera cuts, deadpan humor, Americans reacting in foreign countries where they are powerless, and nail-biting suspense until it seems something must snap. Even if the story does become a little too implausible due to the fact that the story arc suddenly becomes the focus of an even greater conspiracy, the film succeeds in not trying to trick the audience with cheap shots (for example the sudden appearance of a person on camera accompanied by a crashing swell of violins) but with the fear of the unknown and that death is only a shadow away. Very smart.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m not really a t.v. watcher - except between the ages of 6 and 8 and &#34;General Hospital&#34; still had Luke and Laura - but there are a few exceptions and I definitely think that &#34;King of Queens&#34; is one of them. Every decade has it\&#39;s classics and I think that this show will (or damn-well should) be amongst this decade\&#39;s best. Its comedic timing is awesome and can, at times, be down right odd. On a more \&#39;serious\&#39; note the actors more than succeed in conveying subtle - and not so subtle :)- complexities in their characters without getting too hokey. One commenter wrote that it may take a couple of episodes to get into it and I agree; it\&#39;s definitely one that kind of grows on you but once you\&#39;re in, you\&#39;re pretty much hooked. And with good reason!&#39;

b&#39;&#34;The next Karate Kid&#34; is an outstanding movie full of adventure and new surprises. It has a wonderful plot and moral that tells a wonderful story. Hilary Swank does an incredible job of achieving the role of Julie. I have seen the actor who plays Mr. Miagee and this is one of his best performances in my opinion. The movie is funny and charming and I cannot stress enough about how interesting the movie is. I definantly gove this movie a 10 out of 10. I suggest the movie to anyone who likes a good movie.&#39;

b&#34;I agree with all aforementioned comments. This show was a delight to watch. Funny, witty, terrific acting and zany sets. It&#39;s always a thrill to find a show that is smartly written, assumes the audience has brains and displays subtle humor. I would spend good, hard-earned cash money to see it again on DVD. And as long as we&#39;re requesting Smart Series That Never Got a Chance...How about DVD releases of Maximum Bob (another well written, odd duck show with a delightful cast of characters.) And add to the list...Middle Ages or Frank&#39;s Place. There has to a way to release these shows out of the vaults and into the hands of devoted fans and new audiences.&#34;

b&#39;I thought this was very &#34;different&#34; compared to most modern interpretations of Shakespeare and enjoyed it thoroughly. It would not be useful for those studying it at school etc. as it does not show the traditional Shakespeare character interpretations (i.e- Miranda is portrayed quite punky compared to your traditional Shakespeare lady) but for understanding of the play and for the basis of the story it is a very strong piece and fantastic to watch. It does not include also the correct format, as in the layout of acts and scenes as I am currently playing Miranda in a production and most of her lines had been cut and some scenes split and mixed around but it is very useful and I would definitely recommend it as a must-see even if just to say you\&#39;ve seen it! Shakespeare fans would love this!&#39;

b&#39;Although it isn\&#39;t half as hilarious as &#34;Chicken Run,&#34; the new Wallace and Gromit comedy &#34;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#34; (*** out of ****) yields more laughs than most live action comedies. British director Nick Park, who created the Wallace and Gromit characters, and co-director Steve Box rely on the old-fashioned, stop-motion method of animation--known best as claymation--to create several visually adorable characters in more than enough side-splitting scenes about a monstrously mutant hare out to devour every vegetable in sight. Amusing as its whimsical storyline is, the heart of the hilarity lies in the imaginative way with which Park and company have painstakingly constructed characters and gags out of a brand of modeling clay called Plasticine. Basically, every shot that you see in &#34;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#34; required patient souls that made minor alterations in the clay characters for a series of individual shots that merge into a veritable montage of merriment. Hollywood pioneered claymation as a form of animation as far back as the silent movies of the 1920s, before the industry turned its back on the complicated process. Aardman Studio animators managed to crank out a mere three seconds of usable footage per day. For the record, &#34;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#34; took five years to make. The lumpy looking characters, with thumb-prints clearly visible in their respective clay complexions, look incredibly funny with their ping-pong ball eyes and over-biting mouths. Interestingly, Gromit emerges as the funniest character, a lovable mutt with no mouth but an expressively inexpressive face who says more than most of the talking characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wallace and Gromit are respectively master and pooch. As the human half of the duo, Wallace is a homily looking moron without a clue who somehow manages to construct machines that do some rather incredible things. One of the funnier scenes shows master and pooch awakened by a system of chutes, hatches, and spring-operated contraptions that dress and feed them. Meanwhile, Gromit is the animal half. The running joke is that Gromit shows more common sense than his genius of a master. As good as his ideas and inventions are, Wallace could not succeed without the loyal Gromit giving him a hand. Our heroes run a pest protection business called \&#39;Anti-Pesto.\&#39; Essentially, they must protect every vegetable patch for miles around using an ungainly looking device called a Bun-Van 6000 that literally sucks rabbits out of their ground and into a huge glass container. No, Wallace and Gromit don\&#39;t kill the critters. Instead, they keep them as pets, and Wallace experiments with an invention\xc2\x97Mind-O-Matic--designed to convert hares into carrot-haters. This &#34;Frankenstein&#34; meets &#34;The Fly&#34; approach plunges poor Wallace into deep trouble when he swaps bits of his brain with that of a rabbit. Not long thereafter, a mysterious towering terror stalks the vegetable patches on full moon nights and creates chaos for everyone as the village\&#39;s 517th annual Vegetable Contest approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, Wallace and Gromit appeared in Park\&#39;s Oscar-nominated, film school project &#34;A Grand Day Out&#34; (1989). Since then Aardman has released ten other animated shorts, among them &#34;Wallace and Gromit: A Close Shave&#34; (1993) and the Oscar-winning Wallace and Gromit: The Wrong Trousers&#34; (1995). &#34;Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#34; differs not only because it represents the duo\&#39;s big-screen debut, but also it runs a whopping 85 minutes. The first two-thirds of &#34;Were-Rabbit&#34; contain better gags than the last third, but Park and company never miss a chance to slip in an adult joke that kids won\&#39;t get but attentive grown-ups will appreciate. &#34;Wallace and Gromit: The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&#34; is hare-raising fun.&#39;

b&#34;I just finished watching this (last weekend) and found it absolutely hillarious, some of the scenes I just couldn&#39;t stop laughing at! Dennis is soooo amazingly thick sometimes, and just says the stoopidest things...but at the same time he&#39;s just being cool to impress his girlfriend (who gets arrested anyway!) The beach scenery is very tranquil...until along comes Robbie Coltrane...! Not the greatest movie ever made but certainly something to think about renting on a Saturday night when you haven&#39;t got much else to do (like I did). You might need to hunt around for it though - I was lucky, as my local video store stocks it.&#34;

b&#34;When I first saw the ad for this, I was like &#39;Oh here we go. He&#39;s done High School Musical, but he can&#39;t coast along on that so now he&#39;s making appearances on other Disney shows&#39;. Personally, I love The Suite Life and I&#39;m a big fan of Ashely Tisdale. But for some reason, I&#39;m not too keen on Zac Efron, although all my friends think he&#39;s the best thing since Jesse McCartney. But he really annoys me. Anyway, I watched the show (taking a break from English coursework) and was pleasantly surprised. The performances were good all round, especially from the regular characters on The Suite Life, and Zac Efron wasn&#39;t as bad as I had anticipated. All in all, a pretty good show.&#34;

b&#39;Ernst Lubitsch gave us wonderful films like Design for Living, Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, To be or not to be, and other wonderful films. But People usually put Bluebeard\&#39;s eighth wife as one of Lubitsch\&#39;s weakest films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I consider this film as an important film. This film began the collaboration of Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder. Charles Brackett, Billy Wilder, and Walter Reisch wrote the screenplay for Ernst Lubitsch\&#39;s Ninotchka. Of Course, Lubitsch worked with writers in the scripting process. After that, Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder worked together. They together wrote the screenplay for famous films like The Lost Weekend and Sunset Blvd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are lots of funny moments in the film. I thought &#34;The Taming of the Shrew&#34; was very funny. There is a famous expression called &#34;Films are slices of Life.&#34; And Here is a great example from Bluebeard\&#39;s eighth wife (1938).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the first session of the scripting process, Lubitsch posed this question: how do the boy and girl get together? Billy Wilder promptly suggested that the opening scene should be the men\&#39;s shop of a department store. &#34;The boy is trying to buy a pajama,&#34; he extemporized glibly. &#34;But he sleeps only in the tops. He is thrifty so he insists on buying only the tops. The clerk says he must buy the pants too. It looks like a catastrophe. Then the girl comes into the shop and buys the pants because she sleeps only in the pants.&#34; Ernst Lubitsch and Charles Brackett were enchanted. It wasn\&#39;t till months later they discovered that Billy Wilder himself is a tops-only sleeper and that he had been nursing the idea for months waiting for a chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this information from a book. I think this film can be considered as the return of Ernst Lubitsch. Right after this film, he made wonderful films like Ninotchka, The Shop around the Corner, and To be or not to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought Gary Cooper\&#39;s performance was good. I think Lubitsch casted Gary Cooper probably because Gary Cooper played Long Fellow Deeds who inherited the fortune in Frank Capra\&#39;s Mr. Deeds goes to town. But this is just my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I highly enjoyed the film. I rate this film 9 out of 10. Lubitsch films are different, because his films are slices of life.&#39;

b&#39;By 1950, John Ford had already fully-developed the ideas and motifs that would form the core of his most successful Westerns. Always present, for example, is a strong sense of community, most poignantly captured in the Joad family of Steinbeck\&#39;s \&#39;The Grapes of Wrath (1940).\&#39; Within these communities, even amid Ford\&#39;s loftier themes of racism and the pioneer spirit, there\&#39;s always room for the smaller human interactions, the minor friendships and romances that make life worth living. \&#39;Wagon Master (1950)\&#39; came after Ford had released the first two films in his &#34;cavalry&#34; trilogy \xc2\x96 \&#39;Fort Apache (1948)\&#39; and \&#39;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949)\&#39; \xc2\x96 and it covers similar territory, only without the military perspective and, more damningly, the strong lead of John Wayne. Ben Johnson and Harry Cary, Jr. are fine actors, but they feel as though they should be playing second-fiddle to somebody, and Ward Bond\&#39;s cursing Mormon elder, while potentially a candidate for such a role, isn\&#39;t given quite enough focus to satisfactorily fit the bill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In \&#39;Wagon Master,\&#39; Ford seems so comfortable with his tried-and-tested Western formula that any character development is largely glossed over. Ben Johnson\&#39;s romance with Joanne Dru is treated as an obligation more than anything else, and Harry Cary Jr\&#39;s charming of a Mormon girl is so perfunctory as to be almost nonexistent in the final film, leaving one to ponder the survival of deleted scenes. Only in Charles Kemper\&#39;s charismatic and shamelessly-villainous Uncle Shiloh does Ford try some different, and it works, even with his being surrounded by a troop of insufferably hammy slack-jawed yokels. Where Ford does succeed is in orchestrating the conglomeration of three distinct races of Americans \xc2\x96 the values-orientated Mormoms, the easygoing horse-traders, the eccentric travelling showmen \xc2\x96 into a cohesive community of pioneers looking towards a bright future. This apparent harmony is thrown into disarray by the arrival of Uncle Shiloh\&#39;s gun-toting outlaws, who exploit the lawlessness of the Western frontier but ultimately lose out to the noble cowboys who &#34;only ever drew on snakes.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ford reportedly considered Wagon Master among the favourite of his films, and perhaps this has something to do with the absence of big names like John Wayne or Henry Fonda. Armed only with his stock selection of usual players, Ford is able to generate a sense of community by avoiding placing focus on any one character, though most of the Mormom travellers still remain completely anonymous. Despite being undoubtedly well-made, I can\&#39;t help feeling that this film only does well what other Ford pictures did even better: the terrific majesty of the the Western frontier was presented more beautifully in \&#39;She Wore a Yellow Ribbon\&#39;; the romances and friendly squabbles among community members took greater prominence in \&#39;Fort Apache\&#39;; the early relations with Native Americans, only hinted at here, were more thoroughly examined in \&#39;The Searchers (1956)\&#39;; the bold pioneering spirit of the early settlers was explored more movingly (albeit by Henry Hathaway and George Marshall) in \&#39;How the West Was Won (1962).\&#39; \&#39;Wagon Master\&#39; is pure John Ford, but it isn\&#39;t a landmark.&#39;

b&#39;John Leguizamo\&#39;s one man shows are hit or miss: Mambo Mouth showed off his intense characterizations and great timing but the material was average, Spic-o-Rama accomplished the former as well but this time the material was funny, Freak is a classic followed by his disappointing Sex-o-holic. But his stuff in Freak showcases his genius and when he\&#39;s in the spotlight he\&#39;s without peer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Freak\&#39;s semi-autobiographical look at the journey of a young man has power and resonance I don\&#39;t think even it\&#39;s creator knew about. By allowing us the chance to see his soul, Mr. Leguizamo gives us an opportunity to project our own life onto his and there can be no greater gift a performer can give. The willingness to drop \&#39;the Wall\&#39;, expose and share is too terrifying for most actors-they use characters to hide behind-but JL goes full-throttle and gleefully smashes any pretenses. Lenny Bruce and Richard Pryor were our best cultural observers/comedians/actors because they spoke from their heart about whatever they noticed in society and the truth provided slashing humor. Combine that with a great actor\&#39;s gift of mimicry and being in-the-moment (not to mention a sense of humanity) and you\&#39;ll see John Leguizamo has the power to do the same. At least in Freak he does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From birth to his first big break and every life altering moment in between, a viewer sees our host and other characters in their most private moments all the while experiencing the pain, hope, and humor that comes with. Looking drained and lean muscled-tight JL is ringing with sweat by evening\&#39;s end having offered up his crazy life for an audience; Spike Lee\&#39;s fluid camera work captures the actor\&#39;s nuances down to the last lip curl and slow blink. The scenarios range from drinking with his machismo-fueled father (when he was 9) to seeing A Chorus Line with his gay, deaf uncle; his first girlfriend\&#39;s vicious humiliation when he strips naked, eager to have sex. A nightmarish first sexual encounter with a large German woman in the back of a Kentucky Fried Chicken follows an unsuccessful attempt to pick up a &#34;drunk lapsed Catholic&#34; in a bar on St.Patty\&#39;s Day. Climaxing in a serious showdown with his mother and father, it\&#39;s here that he shows his true genius: he plays a scene between these two characters and himself and his brother with such a strong dramatic/humourous intensity, you forget you\&#39;re watching only one person. There\&#39;s no costume changes, bad wigs, lighting tricks, or makeup. Just an actor giving his all. It\&#39;s simply amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other actors/comedians that stand out right now are Eddie Izzard and Chris Rock but they don\&#39;t dive into themselves as deeply as John Leguizamo does; that\&#39;s not a criticism, not by a long shot. I love their work but Freak is different. It\&#39;s moving in a no-b******* way. It\&#39;s the best one man show out there and no one will be able to touch it for a long time.&#39;

b&#39;Trilogies are very interesting. Some go out with a bang (Lord of the Rings), some get progressively weaker (The Matrix), some get lost in obscurity (Blade, Back to the Future), but some maintain the genius, that seemingly ever-growing bright light that floats beyond the surface of its flawless exterior. Case and point: &#34;Three Colors Trilogy&#34;. This chapter in the trilogy, being the last one, is the most philosophical and thought-provoking. In &#34;Blue&#34; we had a more visually stunning, more character-driven plot, in &#34;White&#34; it was more of a light hearted, narrative-driven story where we listen more to what the characters say than anything. &#34;Red&#34;, however is focused on the &#34;what ifs&#34; and &#34;how comes&#34;. It questions our own fate and focuses mainly on the past and the future than the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This chapter is about a young model who runs over a dog and brings him back to his owner. She soon finds out that the owner of the dog is actually a cynical retired judge who spies on his neighbors\&#39; phone calls through advanced spying equipment. All three films in the trilogies have very basic plot lines, but bring a lot more to the story. Consider in &#34;Blue&#34;, the story of a woman dealing with the loss of her loved ones. We are constantly shown ideas about the contemporary French society and how that reflects the character\&#39;s behavior. &#34;Red&#34; is not only about a young woman who finds shelter in an older man\&#39;s life, but it is also about chance, hope, and fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Irene Jacob stars as Valentine Dussaut, who at first finds the old man (Jean-Louis Trintignant), whom we never find the name of, extremely self-centered and disgusting. Though through self reflective analysis, and her voyeuristic intentions, she learns that the judge would be the perfect man for her, if only he was 40 years younger. Irene lives across from another, younger judge, who highly resembles the old man. This is the &#34;what if&#34; that keeps circling in the movie. What if Irene were born 40 years ago? The old man would have been her perfect match. But what if the younger judge is actually her perfect match, since he so closely resembles the older one. Valentine doesn\&#39;t know this, only we do, and Krzysztof Kieslowski subtly suggests this in almost every frame which Irene is in. We are constantly smacked in the face with his presence, as almost a suggestion of Irene\&#39;s fate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mention that the old man does not have a name for a reason. That reason is because it is very symbolic to the overall theme in the story. We are to compare the old judge to Auguste (Jean-Pierre Lorit), the younger judge, in more than one way. We learn that the old man once had someone he loved but she got away. In another scene, we see Auguste heartbroken as the love of his life gets away with another man. There are constant reminders of whether or not Valentine will ever meet this man. Even though they pass each other without noticing every single day. There is also the motif of the telephone, to Valentine it is a way of keeping sane and updating her life, to Auguste it is what leads to his heartbreak, and to the old man, it is the only thing he has left. These three elements serve to shadow the characters own psychology. It is a sort of statement about what they are and who they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All three &#34;Colors&#34; films stand for a certain principle, most common in France. &#34;Blue&#34; stands for Liberty (the personal being), &#34;White&#34; stands for Equality (being accepted by more than one), and &#34;Red&#34; is Fraternity (to socialize, to learn). And although this final chapter is an obvious focus on the Fraternity principle, Kieslowski makes sure he brings in the other two as well, in order to connect all three stories. For example, we see the old man trying to reach out to Valentine and enlighten her with his spy equipment, which is a reflection of the Equality principle. We also see near the end that Valentine is doing some soul searching and that she\&#39;s more concerned about herself than others (not picking up the phone when Michel calls), a clear example of Liberty. And with all three principles established, Kieslowski nicely connects all of the characters as well, in the final and most heartfelt scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Red&#34; is about where you could have been if you were older or younger. It is about whether or not there is someone completely perfect for everyone, and whether or not one person can change your life. The final chapter in the most awe-inspiring trilogy ever made, this film breaks barriers in both directing and storytelling. It is not only about our modern life, but about where life could and should be in our modern time. And although the movie is more subtle than both &#34;Blue&#34; and &#34;White&#34;, it boldly exclaims a statement of love and compassion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s hard to imagine that &#34;Red&#34; was Kieslowski\&#39;s last film, and that he died at such a young age. Nevertheless, the trilogy will always be his masterpiece and we will always remember him for his work that ranks right up with Bergman, Fellini, and Wenders as a truly remarkable director who\&#39;s never been awarded with an Oscar. Kieslowski, you have been missed!&#39;

b&#34;A lot of things in this futuristic satire are more theoretically funny than actually funny (though it does have some laugh-out-loud moments) but a lot of that is because it seems to have been cut by the studio to better appeal to exactly the idiots it&#39;s mocking. Many situations aren&#39;t allowed to develop, there&#39;s obvious overdubbing of expository material, and worst of all a narrator explains EVERYTHING (most of which needs no explanation), probably because some preview audience didn&#39;t understand what was going on. In other words, a movie about dumbing down has been... you guessed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One hopes that a longer, better version of this comedy will eventually surface on DVD, and it will become the cult fave it deserves to be, but even in this mutilated and somewhat comic- spirit-diminished form it&#39;s one of the more memorable films of the year-- a screech of disgust against our culture and all the ways it&#39;s become trashified, stupidified and uglified in the name of appealing to the yahoos. I watched it right after Land of the Dead, George Romero&#39;s latest milking of the single idea that consumers = zombies, which is basically the same point Judge is making; yet where Romero&#39;s counterculture viewpoint (now zombies = underclass that needs to revolt against the rich) seems hopelessly out of date, Judge&#39;s take is fresh, dead-on and far more disturbing. Just listen to the yahoos in your movie audience whooping it up for President Camacho&#39;s State of the Union just like their counterparts on screen, and you&#39;ll know that we&#39;re all doomed.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;What Alice Found&#34; is the greatest movie that nobody\&#39;s ever heard of! I underestimated it when I heard of it, and I though that it would all sex, no plot, and just really stupid, but in reality, it was really good. They say all indie movies suck, but this one, and &#34;Napoleon Dynamite&#34; didn\&#39;t suck. I asked my friend, who\&#39;d seen it before I did, and she said that Alice has all these three-ways, and you see all this nudity, but no, there is no three-way that I remember, and little nudity. The movie did have a point, and it taught me never trust hitchhikers. I liked that in the end, they got Alice a little dolphin In the end, on her way to Flordia. I totally suggest seeing this movie.&#39;

b&#39;Brilliant thriller, deserving far more fame, Mitchum and Ryan are awesome in their starring roles, as is the entire supporting cast. A truly gripping film noir featuring some wonderfully images and some great dialogue, at the heart of it all is a strong message of tolerance and understanding. Based on a novel concerning homophobia, this movie attacks post-war anti-emitism, and all intolerance and hatred, with considerable power. Though parts may seem a little preachy to modern audiences, it still has the power to shock, and works very well as a thriller in its own right. A credit to all involved.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;ve watched a lot of television in my 51 years, but I&#39;ve never had so much fun week after week, as I had watching Oz. The acting by the entire cast was excellent. The writing was just perfect, with every character remaining consistent throughout the six year run. I also enjoyed the mayhem and the ultra-violence. It may sound odd, but it was at times, comical finding out how one of the characters would eventually end up dead. I particularly enjoyed the true romance and love between Beecher and Keller. Those two men really knew how to throw down, in every way possible. I truly hope that HBO will continue to show us re-runs of this great show FOREVER! I&#39;ve watched every episode at least 4 times yet I still look forward to Tuesday and Thursday nights at 11 p.m. for an episode of this fun and very entertaining show.&#34;

b&#34;Dr. Paul Flanner (Richard Gere), a successful surgeon, has his wife leave him, his son (an uncredited James Franco) not respect him and looses a patient he&#39;s operating on. Adrienne Willis (Diane Lane) has two children and discovers her husband has cheated on her. They both need to get away. She watches over a beautiful oceanside inn in Rodanthe at the same time he books a room. They&#39;re all alone together. You can pretty much figure out the rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what&#39;s known as a weepie or a woman&#39;s film. It&#39;s beautifully shot with a romantic setting and lots of quiet scenes. There&#39;s tragedy, romance, more tragedy and an uplifting ending (sort of). The great acting by Gere and Lane helps disguise the fact that this film isn&#39;t really about much. Every single bit of the plot is predictable. I rolled my eyes a lot at some of the events. Also it&#39;s far too short--I didn&#39;t believe the romance between Gere and Lane for a second. If comes out of nowhere and moves VERY quickly. Still the movie does work. The inn itself is absolutely gorgeous and I was in tears by the end along with most of the audience. So it&#39;s a predictable but gorgeous movie with some wonderful acting. It doesn&#39;t deserve all the criticism it&#39;s getting. I give it a 7.&#34;

b&#34;This movie was much better than I expected. After a couple of films by Will Smith that weren&#39;t that great like I, Robot, he is back to being likable and fun in this one. Smith plays, Hitch, a date doctor. Most of the film centers around him teaching Albert how to be himself and get a date with Allegra Cole, a rich famous celebrity whom he works with. Albert is a klutz and goof and always tripping on his feet or what-not. All Hitch does is teach him how to act more cool and not be so nervous around Allegra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During all this, Hitch meets Sara, a gossip columnist whom has sworn off men. Hitch charms her, so of course, they go out. But, Hitch may teach other guys how to get the girl to fall for them, he doesn&#39;t believe in love himself. He has never really had a girl since he was dumped in college. But, he likes Sara, so keeps going after her. Sara&#39;s friend is hurt by guy whom she thinks went to the date doctor. So Sara tracks the doctor down, only to learn its Hitch. So of course, she thinks he&#39;s a pig. Then it&#39;s up to hitch to explain to Sara and Allegra what he does, so they both end up forgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL VERDICT: Good, has some laughs, and is entertaining. I recommend it.&#34;
b&#39;1.0&#39;
b&#39;I have to admit that I liked this film much more than I expected to. Will Smith has that clean-cut charm that you just can\&#39;t help but like. The plot was a minor twist on basic romantic comedy stuff, somewhat reminiscent of Jane Austen\&#39;s &#34;Emma&#34;. This guy Kevin James has a real flair for comic timing and physical comedy. I have never seen his TV show, but he was cast very well in this film. Amber Valletta was good enough. I can\&#39;t remember why she was a rich celebrity in this film, but if she was supposed to be an actress or model, then the casting might have left something to be desired. I enjoyed Julie Ann Emery, and wish she\&#39;d had a larger part. But, saving the best for last, Eva Mendes more or less stole the show. Her beauty, and charm, and just the right amount of standoffishness had me glued to the screen whenever she was there. I hope to see more of her in the future. This film is definitely worth checking out.&#39;

b&#39;Of all the 48 films of Brigitte Bardot, &#34;Une Parisienne&#34; is widely regarded as (one of) her best. What we see is special: for once the plot has a value of its own, does much more than only providing a cheap vehicle for BB\&#39;s sex-charged appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film is your true &amp; well worked-out light comedy, with a good and coherent story. Set in France\&#39;s government circles in the late 1950\&#39;s, it entertains from beginning to end. Providing many amusing twists &amp; turns and some slapstick -- all acted out by at least three starring leads, including Bardot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Une Parisienne&#34; (= French for &#34;female inhabitant of Paris&#34;) focuses on telling a story, not on showing Brigitte Bardot. Brigitte serves the plot very well by using her talent for acting in light comedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you settle on your couch on a Friday-night, tired and weary from a week\&#39;s slaving away, just turn on &#34;Une Parisienne&#34;. This film will make you feel better.&#39;

b&#39;This film is about a single mother who is happy go lucky to the point that she is almost irresponsible, and her sensible teenage daughter who is undergoing adolescent turmoils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; is an engaging film from beginning to the end. Both Ann and Adele are described well right at the start, so we get to know how different their personalities are. Clashes inevitably ensue, and they are engagingly presented. I find myself so drawn to their state of minds and their circumstances. it is as if I am living their lives, feeling what they are feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Sarandon gives another excellent performance in &#34;Anywhere But Here&#34;. She is charismatic, happy go lucky, hedonistic, warm and loving all at once. I have always liked Susan Sarandon, and I think she is grossly underrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Anywhere But Here&#34; is a captivating emotional journey.&#39;

b&#34;It is hard to know what category to put this film in, most films set in this time period of US history are westerns but here instead of the wide open plains of the west the action is almost entirely confined to a claustrophobic girls boarding school in Louisiana.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film opens with Amy, a young girl, walking though the woods picking mushrooms, as she does so she stumbles upon Corporal John &#39;McBee&#39; McBurney, a wounded Union soldier, who she takes back to the school. We know that he isn&#39;t a particularly nice person when he kisses her on the lips to distract her from alerting a passing Confederate patrol even though she told him she was twelve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once back at the school opinions are divided about what should be done with their new guest, some think they should look after him till his wounds are healed while others believe that it is treason not to hand him over to Confederate forces at the first opportunity. The former group prevail and he gradually recovers. As he does so his presence has an effect on all of the girls who haven&#39;t had a man on site for a long time, including a young teacher and the head mistress who&#39;s previous relationship appears to have been with her own brother. McBee sets about seducing them, emotionally if not physically, this leads to considerable jealousy amongst the girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this film is rated fifteen it is definitely not for younger viewers both for the sexual content, of which little is actually shown but much is implied, and for a very gruelling scene which had me squirming more than any other scene in any film I&#39;ve seen for quite some time. It is interesting to see Clint Eastwood play against type, instead of being heroic his character is both unpleasant and for most of the time at the mercy of the women around him. The acting is solid throughout, not just from Eastwood but also from all the actresses, including the young Pamelyn Ferdin who played Amy.&#34;

b&#34;Obviously the previous reviewers here are not fans of this genre, but I think this one is done quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s twistedly cute clever &amp; dark. This story brought back memories of the types of girls I was in love with as a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it makes me want to check out some of Nadia&#39;s other movies, many youtube comments about how hot she is in this video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure there is some Burton influence here, but I wouldn&#39;t say this Brad is trying to rip him off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is just jumping in &amp; adding his talents to a genre that I can appreciate. I like what he does &amp; he does it well, nuff said!&#34;

b&#34;Being Of Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised when watching the movie. I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven&#39;t seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history.&#34;

b&#39;If I assume that you know what this film is about, I am also forced to assume that you\&#39;ve come to this review knowing that you will probably watch it regardless of what I say. If all this rings true - read on - you are likely to find some consonance with at least part of this review. If you\&#39;re undecided, or not really entirely certain what happened in the late \&#39;70s and early \&#39;80s in the urban and suburban youth music culture, you should probably read one of the reviews which pretends to be objective instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although I didn\&#39;t grow up in California, the American punk scene was the first music scene I ever truly lived in. At the height of the hardcore I was immersed in from about 1979-1981 everybody had a band and the only common denominators between bands and indeed members of their audiences were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the rejection of conformity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* tolerance and enjoyment of difference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* a desire to have fun - hard and fast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hairstyles, politics, dislike of authority figures, and violent slam-dancing were not integral to what I experienced, though there were certainly cliques or factions who tended to be intolerant of those who did not dress, speak or act &#34;punk&#34; enough. And there was often a certain amount of unearned credit extended from some of these cliques to those who tried really hard to live down to the fascistic paradigm of anarchic, self mutilating, angry young cop-haters. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the interviews with audience punks in Penelope Spheeris\&#39; excellent Cal-Punk documentary &#34;Decline of Western Civilization&#34; present a very narrow view of the subculture some of us enjoyed, the interviews with the bands, club owners, promoters and even the security people are much more representative of at least my own perspective and memories of \&#39;the scene\&#39;. nevertheless, it is possible for those who approach this with prejudices about what punk is to experience this film without having their preconceptions challenged. Unfortunate as this is, the blame for it rests solely with those who promote, believe in or feel comfortable with stereotypes - Not the film-makers. Don\&#39;t blame the messenger. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music presented here is not going to be for everybody - nor even most. It\&#39;s not the most crude stuff out there, but it\&#39;s loud, obnoxious, fast, and less concerned with technique than with raw energy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, seeing early Black Flag with Ron Reyes singing, X, Fear and the Circle Jerks was worth far more than the cost of this hard to obtain film. As much as I like The Germs, seeing Darby Crash for the mess - and the nice guy - that he was left me a bit cold. Nevertheless, the scenes of Darby playing with his pet tarantula while &#34;Shut Down&#34; droned on and on in the background were precious. The X interview is also great. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spheeris\&#39; straightforward documentary style is supplemented by wild pans and zooms during the musical segments. During the interviews, framing is used very nicely to provide context for whatever is being said. Considering her experience and the budget, Spheeris did as well as anybody could have with this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for those who appreciate what this film is actually about, and for those who have forgotten those few years of fun, honest, direction-less rebellion before Amaerican punk was co-opted into yet another flow within the musical mainstream and the stereotypes became more important than the basic philosophy.&#39;

b&#34;When dirty dancing was on TV in the middle of last year I was out so I didn&#39;t get to see it, my mum swore that I had seen it and that she had it on tape somewhere. Anyway getting to the point she couldn&#39;t find her video so for Christmas I bought her the DVD, well she hasn&#39;t had a look in. It sat around for a while then one night I decided to take it upstairs to watch and I fell in love with it. This is a great film with lots of lovely scenes! I love the plot and enjoyed every moment of it! It&#39;s definitely not for everyone but if you love a love story then you will want to watch Dirty Dancing again and again! Dirty Dancing - The Way Love Is Meant To Be!&#34;

b&#39;If Monte Hellman\&#39;s legendary early 70\&#39;s road movie masterpiece &#34;Two-Lane Blacktop&#34; had been done more like a stark, stripped-down, fiercely taut and straightforward brooding mood piece embellished upon by that distinctly mean\&#39;n\&#39;lean, rough\&#39;n\&#39;tough, very raw and ragged macho Australian mentality and topped off with a generous sprinkling of dour, despairing, no-hope-whatsoever end-of-the-road punk nihilism, it would undoubtedly be much similar to this jarringly bleak and atmospheric knockout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice guy factory worker Mike (an appealingly scruffy Terry Serio) runs afoul of sneering, shades-wearing fascist car race champ Fox (a perfectly hateful Richard Moir) when he steals Fox\&#39;s fetching model girlfriend Julie (the lovely Deborah Conway) away from him. Mike and Fox begin competing in increasingly lethal races in which the stakes become higher and higher with each successive bout, finally culminating in an especially pulse-pounding all-or-nothing race with only one true winner allowed. Mike, assisted by his worried, but loyal Italian mechanic pal Tony (a splendidly smooth turn by Vangelis Mourikis) and tutored by blind, supremely hip 50\&#39;s-style greaser rebel (marvelously essayed with maximum coolness by Max Cullen), willingly puts his life on the line for the sake of his reputation, the affection of his old lady, the money, and, most importantly, for the chance to topple the haughty Fox from his gloating, glowering thrown. Directed with utmost gravity and intensity by John Clark, written to laconically right-on perfection by Barry Tomblim, with a shivery, flesh-crawling synthesizer score by Peter Crosbie and spare, unadorned cinematography by David Gribble, this authentically gnarly early 80\&#39;s item presents the concept of racing cars as not only a funky alternate lifestyle, but also an all-consuming obsession and reason for living (it\&#39;s the sole thing most of the film\&#39;s characters are really passionate about) with a remarkably astute and unblinking eye. Complete with a harrowing downbeat ending and unsparingly grim central message about the bitter price one pays for being top dog, this riveting depiction of a dead-end existence rates as an extraordinary cinematic achievement.&#39;

b&#34;This film was made soon enough after Karen&#39;s passing that perhaps Richard Carpenter and the people closest to Karen were feeling a little guilty as to how they may have contributed to her health problems. As the years have passed (almost 25 to be exact) it must have gotten easier to deny any complicity. Richard has spent the years after Karen&#39;s death endlessly remixing and recompiling the recordings he made with her. He married his cousin, Mary, and from what I have read, it looks like he may be planning a next generation Carpenters with his children. He seems to have regretted making this film,and that may very well be why it is unavailable in any form. It seemed to me to be a fairly honest assessment of the tragically short life and incredible talent that was Karen Carpenter.&#34;

b&#39;Each guy Liv Tyler meets loses their head over her, not, of course, without some small encouragement from Liv. Liv is at her beautiful best, with Matt Dillon tops among the paramours. Interesting initial premise, to tell story from perspective of each dupe, degenerates into sitcom-style finale (not unlike Blame It On Rio, with which it has more than a few similarities). Worth watching nonetheless.&#39;

b&#34;From the perspective of the hectic, contemporary world in which we live, the so called `good old days&#39; always seem so much more serene and innocent; an idyllic era gone by of which we have only memories and shadows that linger on the silver screen, as with `Christmas In Connecticut,&#39; a warm and endearing film directed by Peter Godfrey. Barbara Stanwyck stars as Elizabeth Lane, a popular `Martha Stewart&#39; type magazine columnist who writes about life on her beloved farm in Connecticut, always with the latest recipe at the center of the story. One of her biggest fans is Alexander Yardley, played by Sidney Greenstreet, the publisher of the magazine for which she writes. Yardley has never visited her farm, and in response to an idea expressed to him in a letter from a nurse, Mary (Joyce Compton), he decides to spend an old fashioned Christmas with Elizabeth, her husband and child and, as a special guest, a certain Mr. Jefferson Jones (Dennis Morgan), a sailor just recovered from spending fifteen days at sea on a raft after his ship was torpedoed. Elizabeth of course cannot refuse her boss, but there are problems; not the least of which is the fact that she has no farm and writes her column from the comfort of a high-rise in the city. It makes for a precarious situation for her as well as her editor, Dudley Beecham (Robert Shayne), as the one thing Mr. Yardley demands from his employees is total honesty. What follows is a charming and delightfully romantic comedy that transports the audience back to a seemingly more simple time and place, to share a Christmas Past where a warm hearth, good food and kindness prevail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barbara Stanwyck absolutely sparkles as Elizabeth, with a smile and presence warmer than anything the grandest hearth could provide, and totally convincing as a city girl entirely out of her element on the farm. Morgan also fares well as the somewhat naive sailor, whose trust in his fellow man is admirable. Even with the deceptions being played out around him, he&#39;s the kind of guy you know will somehow land on his feet, and in the end it&#39;s Elizabeth you really feel for. One of the true delights of this film, however, is Sidney Greenstreet. His Yardley has a gruff exterior, but beneath you know without a doubt that this is a man with a heart as big as Texas. It&#39;s a straightforward, honest portrayal, and it&#39;s a joy to watch him work; the most memorable scenes in the movie belong to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The supporting cast includes Reginald Gardiner (John Sloan), the terrific Una O&#39;Connor (Norah), Frank Jenks (Sinkewicz) and Dick Elliott (Judge Crothers). A feel-good movie that plays especially well during the Christmas Season (though it would work any time of the year), `Christmas In Connecticut&#39; is a memorable film that never takes itself too seriously, is thoroughly uplifting and will leave you with a warm spot in your heart and a sense of peace that makes the world seem like a good place to be. It&#39;s a true classic, and one you do not want to miss. I rate this one 10/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#39;OK, so the following review is more of a synopsis more so than really containing any spoilers, but better safe than sorry so as to avoid being blacklisted, right? Right! Consider yourselves officially warned, and read on...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this parody/tribute to the greatest time in horror movie history - the 1980\&#39;s - a group of stupid teens are getting together to host a seance in the house of the notorious Murder McGee, who butchered his entire family a few years back and buried them in the back yard. As I\&#39;m sure you can guess, things go from bad to worse faster than you can say &#34;Where\&#39;s the beef??&#34; and in typical 80\&#39;s horror movie fashion the deaths are bloody, the dialogue is cheesy, and beautiful women are taking off their clothes every chance they get. Good times...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No clique or 80\&#39;s horror movie clich\xc3\xa9d characterizations are left unrepresented here. In fact, no stone was left unturned at all \xc2\x96 we have the cool hero, his innocent girlfriend, the Goth chick, the tough thug (think John Bender), the hot blonde who keeps losing her shirt, the shy dork in love with the hot blonde that keeps losing her shirt, a couple of gorgeous half-naked lesbians, and two big geeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can plainly see, the cast is pretty big. Usually, larger casts are where things can fall apart quickly, with one or two sour apples buggering up the whole barrel. Not in this case though. Not a single cast member left me disappointed. The acting was very well done. Everyone from the cool hero in his Thriller jacket played by Jovan Meredith to the grooovy Goth chick played by Renee Dorian to Geeks One &amp; Two played by Cory Assink &amp; Jonathan Brett \xc2\x96 they all played it straight, brought their A-game, and knocked it out of the park. If you\&#39;re a fan of Gary &amp; Wyatt in Weird Science, you\&#39;ll immediately fall in love with the geeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Director/co-writer Jeff C. Smith is a guy to watch for in the future, trust me on this. If this is what he can do with a low budget, there are nothing but good things ahead for him when he gets more money for future projects. The characters were dead on; the atmosphere was perfect; the laughs were huge; the blood flowed, and squirted, and sprayed beautifully \xc2\x96 it was just like watching a horror movie from the 1980\&#39;s. Call this one &#34;THE BREAKFAST CLUB meets NIGHT OF THE DEMONS&#34;!!! The tag line says it all, and says it honestly - &#34;EXCESSIVE VIOLENCE; GRATUITOUS NUDITY; ZERO BUDGET&#34; - no false advertising here, folks! As fans of this genre, we have to look to the indies and support these hard-working folks who are busting their humps out there bringing us original tales, lest we forever get stuck in a world filled with big studio watered-down PG-13 \&#39;horror\&#39; or pointless remakes like The Hitcher. No, thank you - no more of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I honestly have to say that STUPID TEENAGERS MUST DIE! is by far one of the best indie flicks I\&#39;ve gotten the pleasure of watching this year. It\&#39;s a bloody good time, and holds up on repeat viewings. From the dialogue to the characters to the wardrobe...even the closing love theme over the end credits (which if that doesn\&#39;t bring back fits of laughter recalling mid-80\&#39;s power ballads by REO Speedwagon - over-pronounced R\&#39;s on every word starting with the letter \&#39;R\&#39; - then I\&#39;ll eat my DVD right now)...bottom line is, if you\&#39;re a fan of 80\&#39;s horror or horror in general, no more hesitation - this flick deserves to be in your collection!!&#39;

b&#39;America\&#39;s Next Top Model is a great reality show in every sense. It has a great hostess, has great guests, a great production and some of the best professionals of the modeling world contributing for something they hadn\&#39;t achieved yet: present a true America\&#39;s Next Top Model. Of course this is not something easy to do, therefore USA and the world already would have 10 top models concurring and fighting between themselves in this cruel world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it\&#39;s obvious that its intention is not to present the America\&#39;s next top model, but yes, the America\&#39;s Next Pop Model. The show gets together a bunch of models without any experience with different personalities and big personal, professional and financial problems, giving them a chance for bringing to life a dream or to make their lives something worthy. It\&#39;s obvious that Tyra Banks uses all that for her advantage, she gives the dream, but in exchange for that she gains audience and more popularity. Anyway, she deserves it, because she is intelligent and, if I might say that, a pioneer to this kind of show. Tyra also is a great observer and knows how to give based opinions, differing herself of other models and hostess of foreign versions of the NEXT TOP MODEL franchise. In Brazil, as an example, Fernanda Motta is its hostess and &#34;once-upon-a-time&#34;-Top Model. She doesn\&#39;t have even 1/10 of Tyra\&#39;s professional skills, which keeps Tyra Banks on the top. Tyra have professional and personal knowledge about what she says and she\&#39;s a great mentor because she not only criticizes but she points the mistake and teaches the right way with wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show doesn\&#39;t suffer from big problems, it does and fulfills what it promises during the cycles. The models chosen to work on the show in fact are not the best unknown models of entire country because Tyra Banks bets with the difference, and she is right, because she (and also good part of her audience) believes that it\&#39;s time for the modeling world to change some straight parameters. During the cycles, she and her team really makes fair deliberations, where the weakest go away and the promising ones have new chances to prove their capacities but must be fast to do that, otherwise they lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other very interesting thing is that Tyra also knows to decide who should or shouldn\&#39;t win even when she\&#39;s against people\&#39;s opinion. She knows that whoever wins will be famous, but has a very few possibilities to truly be a worldwide recognized top model. At the same way she knows that, some times, the second place is more valuable than the first, because 1st place wins the title, but second doesn\&#39;t gets the title stigma. Hardly she makes mistakes when she decides the future of any model during the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 9 cycles the show is getting a little tired with some old ideas, it\&#39;s time for Tyra to change some things and lines because it\&#39;s getting boring and comparing to the firsts cycles we can see that she\&#39;s getting bored too, so she needs to do that if she wants the show to live a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, the show explores the fashion and modeling world, but it\&#39;s also entertaining for those ones that live outside all of that. It gives the opportunity for some girls and also the market, and also gives great tips for those ones from the audience who shares the same dream.&#39;

b&#34;My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger. It&#39;s about Andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But of course, Nicole isn&#39;t that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i&#39;m guessing. She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10&#34;

b&#39;I went to the movies to see Claudine and loved every minute of it the cast and the soundtrack as well. Diahann Carroll was never better than in this role. We saw Ms. Carroll downplayed her looks barely saw her naked,smoked a cigarette, drank beer and oh she cursed. Whenever this movie was shown on TV and finally cable I would call my friends to watch it. Just the soundtrack from the very beginning of the movie is awesome all thanks to Gladys Knight and the Pips. We saw a black woman struggling to raise her children, dealing with teen pregnancy and everyday life meets a man whom she learns later on has issues himself. Finally this movie made it to DVD and well deserving.&#39;

b&#39;I too saw this movie when it first came out. I was a teenager at the time, and I saw it with my girl friend who later became my wife. I remember the movie made me feel it was possible to beat the odds. The cinematography was very well done if memory serves me correctly. The boy was a little much, but the girl character was very interesting. I thought it was very romantic and that might have been the intro to the first time with my then girlfriend. I have not seen the movie since and I wander why it has gone to the wayside. I would love to watch it again to see if it was as good as I remember. The Elton John sound track was excellent.&#39;

b&#34;I always believed that a film that&#39;s plot is centred around a virtual reality video game never sounds as though it&#39;s going to be anything special but eXistenZ proved I couldn&#39;t have been more wrong. This film is unbelievable and, whilst highly entertaining, offers so much more than that. From start to finish, this film has you conceptualising to the point where you can have so many ideas, you can not make a final conclusion. David Cronenberg has a talent for this as he does so many things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eXistenZ is pure Cronenberg; the way it&#39;s written and the way it&#39;s directed is very unique to his style and that can only be a good thing. Cronenberg set himself a clear target with this film and that was to keep the audience guessing which he did with apparent ease. His fondness for the grotesque is not as predominant in this film as it is in The Fly or Naked Lunch but there are still some elements such as the game pods and how they are made that can make the audience wince. With regards to his earlier work, eXistenZ is more a combination of Videodrome and a less violent Scanners, a pretty awesome combination. Setting the film in the not too distant future was a really good decision as it allowed Cronenberg to be extremely imaginative with the films surroundings and also enabled him to visualise more concepts, allowing for less inhibited writing. It was important that the film didn&#39;t become over confusing and Cronenberg avoided this very well by keeping things relatively simple. Besides, if he wanted to make an unwatchable film, he&#39;d know how to do it a lot better than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;eXistenZ boasts an extremely talented cast of character actors and all perform very well. Jennifer Jason Leigh gives the standout performance as the game designer who spends more time out of reality than in to it. Leigh is sexy and commanding in her role as Allegra and she really gets her teeth in to the role. The emotional range she shows in the film is particularly impressive, making her completely believable (if you can believe anything). Jude Law is also good and is very convincing in his character&#39;s fear of implantation. The chemistry between these two is very electric and gives the film an extra bit of flavour. Ian Holm and Willem Dafoe are just two of the great actors in support who add further depth to the film with very colourful performances. The cast of the film isn&#39;t huge but eXistenZ definitely has the &#39;quality is better than quantity&#39; ethic which works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As well as being entertaining and thought provoking, eXistenZ touches social issues such as control and loss of self. This further demonstrates the film as an intellectual vessel and could also explain why it wasn&#39;t a huge Hollywood hit. eXistenZ has so much to offer and although it isn&#39;t to everyone&#39;s taste, those who like Cronenberg&#39;s work or who like science fiction will almost be certain to like this film. It is one of those films that needs to be watched with an open mind but it really is something special.&#34;

b&#39;It is not surprising that this film was made by I\&#39;m at the time it was. I\&#39;m examined the early beauty and tragedy of Chosun Dynasty life in Seopyonje and delightfully explored a well-known Korean folk tale in Chunhyang, and these comprised his last two films. What is most surprising is that Chi Hwa Seon, his 2002 offering, is not presented in the pansori style of those previous two films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, the experienced hand of I\&#39;m comes through. We explore together the life of a real person: a late nineteenth century Chosun Dynasty painter who rides on the edge of modernity but who is not a noble and who, because of that, causes a stir in contemporary Korean society with his fame and his public and artistic expressions of disdain for the old Korean noble class and his contempt for would-be Japanese ruling colonials alike. The painter, Chang Seung Up, known popularly as Oh Won (performed magnificently by Choi Min Sik, the famous star of Park Chan Wook\&#39;s already legendary &#34;OldBoy&#34;) becomes more and more influential and therefore more dangerous throughout the film. Contemporary Korean audiences will back a hero like this despite the fact, or maybe because of the fact, that he was so ostracized in his time. I\&#39;m\&#39;s sense of simultaneous beauty and tragedy in history remains intact. I\&#39;m is a master at capturing his country\&#39;s past idiosyncrasies, and in this film he almost outdoes himself. As expected in an I\&#39;m film, the cinematography is breathtaking, the editing is precise and the story is central.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plots are set against Seung Up, family ties are tested and broken, scandalous behavior is alleged (and is sometimes real), all to bring down the man who &#34;painted fire.&#34; But against all the intricacies of I\&#39;m\&#39;s detailed but sometimes convoluted account of Seung Up\&#39;s life, Seung Up himself somehow manages to survive. He becomes legendary because of his ability to perfectly copy famous Chinese paintings after only one look. Art dealers and agents then besiege him and try to make money off &#34;Oh Won.&#34; In other words, lines of people, who wish to take advantage of the real Seung Up, an artistic star, begin to form. But he refuses to be manipulated. His cleverness in staving off both the massive hordes and the imperial lackeys impresses the audience, if not the cast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does Seung Up think? He possesses powerful emotions and opinions about painting, such as the aesthetic belief that paintings are living things and are never truly finished. He despises those who would try to turn art into profit. And he cares not for politicians who use their might to bring artistic beauty around them and then cast off the artist as traitorous. But he also thinks that painting plays a role in the coming upheavals. Horrid scenes involving foreign invaders from France and Japan are presented. I\&#39;m\&#39;s signature historical epic motif, and his influence in the realm, remains on prominent display in this multi-million dollar epic. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protagonist causes greater grief for himself and those who care for him when he refuses to paint. This is when the story takes on a whole new meaning, one that is not just political, but social in nature. I\&#39;m takes on the issues in laudable realist fashion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He, Oh Won, becomes a Jesus figure. The people believe him capable of artistic miracles and the government feels it needs his artistic support, but the protagonist remains fiercely independent and contemptuous of what others want him to do or be. Eventually, both government and people come down upon Seung Up in a manner taken straight out of the Bible. His holiness becomes human; his humanity is not accepted; he dies for (or escapes from) the sins of the commoners, the art critics, the politicians, who hound him. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But does he die? As with most of I\&#39;m\&#39;s films, a question remains. In this case, does Seung Up really become an immortal hermit? The film does not tackle that question; it merely presents a possible end for the real man of Chang Seung Up, or Oh Won. No death is depicted because no death is known. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is difficult to find fault with this film, but I\&#39;m has become so good at presenting various historical absurdities in his culture that when he does, it hardly surprises anymore. As usual for I\&#39;m\&#39;s films, the cinematography, the editing and the writing are all first rate. It\&#39;s a well-crafted film imbued with I\&#39;m\&#39;s uncanny story-telling ability. Granted, he may be best at doing this through the ancient Korean musical art of pansori. Still, the film contains stretches of this admirable art form, and by the end, viewers feel as if they have become privy to a great, untold story. And they have, because that, precisely, is I\&#39;m\&#39;s gift.&#39;

b&#34;Considering it&#39;s basically low-budget cast, this is a surprisingly good flick about the life and death of rock pioneer Buddy Holly. Gary Busey stars as Holly, who was one of the first to use an electric guitar for pretty much all his music. Backed up by his Crickets, Holly had a string of hits and became a bona fide star before his death in a plane crash along with Richie Valens and The Big Bopper. The film follows his rise to stardom, marriage to his sweetheart and eventual death. I like this film and believe that you will too. Charles Martin Smith also does a great job in this film.&#34;

b&#39;What will be Prospero in the twentieth century, what is his life? Why a man would need to choose to live on an island with his daughter and girl friend? Because it is too hard to live and love in good conditions in &#34;civilisation&#34;. This man (John Cassavetes) is a broken hearted giant, he can command the storm. He\&#39;s got the power, the strengh but he is human. Deep love of life is the subject of this extraordenary movie. The acting is incredible, all the genius of John Cassavetes, Gena Rowlands, Vittorio Gasman and Shakespeare and paul mazursky of course. don\&#39;t miss it it\&#39;ll be a mistake this film is one of the most beautiful I\&#39;ve ever seen.and i\&#39;ve seen a lot of movies.&#39;

b&#34;I saw this movie when it aired on Lifetime back in 2004. I have never seen it since then, but have thought of it often. It left such an impression on me I&#39;ve been searching for it lately. I found it finally and realized it was made just for television. The movie is fabulous- filled with great writing and acting. William Petersen is perfect, as always. This movie left me speechless and in tears. It&#39;s a wonderful story of faith, love, and compassion. Does anybody know how I can obtain a copy of this movie for my home? Is that possible with television movies?? I really would love to see it again. This is a must-have among my collection!!&#34;

b&#34;A fun romp...a lot of good twists and turns! (and we were not even baked!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t know this movie even existed until watching the extra trailers on a Monty Python DVD...(oddly it was there along with The City of Lost Children, and The Adventures of Baron Munchauhsen)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot keeps you wondering throughout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was awesome...Hank Azaria shows his talent again, Bill Bob is Billy Bob...(wecis?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth watching.&#34;

b&#39;Taut, topical political thriller, taking square aim at the controversial US policy of rendition, another appalling Orwell-ian phrase (collateral damage, anyone?) for the illegal interrogation even torture of terrorist suspects by-passing due legal process. The inhuman interrogation is overseen by the Egyptian Chief of Police, himself the target of a fundamentalist suicide - bomb plot, thus entwining the two main plot-lines of the movie. Both work very well, the bombing set-piece graphic and chilling in its realism, with its denouement revealed in a stylish Tarantino-type flashback and the torture scenes on an innocent man also unflinchingly portrayed in all their gory detail. The film scores telling points about the use of torture as a credible means of intelligence - gathering in the war against terrorists and against the unpoliced faceless bureaucracy (here personified by a suitable cold-steeled Meryl Streep, as the CIA boss who casually gives the order for rendition) which can ruin innocent lives. Never mind Kafka\&#39;s fiction, think more the recent killing of the innocent Brazilian in London in 2005, with the Head of the Metropolitan police still in his job and no-one tried for the poor man\&#39;s murder. The acting is excellent throughout - the two key roles of the innocent man and terrorist bomber are realistically and tellingly played by the unfamiliar actors Omar Metwally and Moa Khouas. Similarly Yigal Naor as the intimidating Chief of Police and Zineb Ouhach as his idealistic lovelorn daughter ring true with their performances, their lack of familiarity (at least to me) adding to their characters\&#39; credibility. Of the bigger Hollywood names present, Gyllenhaal\&#39;s stature grows with succeeding films, here playing the initially detached but later conscience - stricken and anguished Government man who does the right thing in the end. Witherspoon plays her distraught wife part mainly in one key but is believable all the same, while David Fabrizio and Alan Arkin convincingly show up self-serving senators and their lackeys who\&#39;ll only go so far to help you until their career prospects are jeopardised. There are a few weaknesses plot-wise; there\&#39;s little dramatic need to create the &#34;suspense&#34; surrounding El-Ibrahimi\&#39;s escape and Streep\&#39;s character is perhaps too obvious a bogey-man/woman. Worst of all is the meaningless inclusion of Gyllenhaal\&#39;s on-the-spot girlfriend, around merely for decoration and a brief gratuitous love-scene. On the whole though, an engrossing thought - provoking cinematic experience.&#39;

b&#39;I think that FARSCAPE is the best scifi since Babylon 5 and is one of the best sci-fi television series of all time (ranking up there with Dr. Who, Blake\&#39;s 7, Red Dwarf, MST3K and the aforementioned B5). I find the characters and races of Farscape are much more interesting and imaginative than the typical &#34;humans-with-birthmarks&#34; that are found in many series. The effects are quite good and the stories engaging. Despite missing the bulk of season 2 and some of season 1, I find the character development very well done.&#39;

b&#39;1983 was &#34;the battle of the Bonds&#34;. That year both Roger Moore and Sean Connery starred in two separate James Bond film, the former (Octopussy) was produced by the &#34;official&#34; makers of the Bond films while the later (Never Say Never Again) was produced &#34;unofficially&#34; by a group led by Kevin McClory who held the film rights to Thunderball. Surprisingly enough is the &#34;unofficial&#34; film that is better despite the obvious flaw of and the fact that Never Say Never Again is a remake of Thunderball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never Say Never Again has the distinction of sporting one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film. It all starts with Sean Connery, returning to the play Bond for the first time since 1971\&#39;s Diamonds Are Forever. Connery might be older then he was then but he looks better here then he did in Diamonds Are Forever. The Bond of Never Say Never Again is the sleek and dangerous shark of Dr. No or From Russia With Love, just a few years older. Connery\&#39;s delivery of one liners and dialogue is as dead on as it ever was. The one downside to Connery\&#39;s age is his believability, especially when it comes to the ladies of the film. Let\&#39;s face it even Connery, despite being in top physical shape, looks as odd as Moore when he is bedding women half his age. Yet despite this believability issue, Never Say Never Again shows Connery in one of his better Bond performances and a definite improvement on his two earlier Bond performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kim Bassinger plays Domino in one of her early film roles. Bassinger plays the role with considerable confidence for a relative newcomer and she makes the character believable. Bassinger holds her own against her co-stars and has considerable chemistry with them as well. In fact she may well outshine her Thunderball counter-part played by Claudine Auger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there\&#39;s the villain, Maximilian Largo played by Klaus Maria Brandauer. Brandauer\&#39;s Largo is everything a James Bond film villain should be: suave, charming, evil and above all believable none the less. Brandauer makes the role realistic and chooses not to fall into the trap many other Bond villains have fallen into by going over the top. Brandauer plays Largo with a silent menace and charisma unseen in many adversaries of 007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The excellent cast extends into the supporting cast as well. Barbara Carrera makes a fine henchwoman in Fatima Blush and the screen lights up when she appears. Max Von Sydow a nice appearance as Blofeld, though his appearance is more akin to a cameo. Rowan Atkinson makes an appearance as Bond\&#39;s bumbling contact that makes for some of the best scenes in the film. With all that the highlight of the supporting cast comes from the MI6 staff from Edward Fox\&#39;s M who makes for a great contrast to Bernard Lee, Pamela Salem who make s affine Moneypenny and the icing on the cake with Alec McCowen\&#39;s wonderful Q. The supporting cast has a couple of misfires though in the form of Bernie Casey as Felix Leiter and Gavin O\&#39;Herlihy as Jack Petachi who both seem to lack credibility in their respective roles. Otherwise this film sports one of the best casts ever assembled for a Bond film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of an excellent cast the film has several other essential ingredients. From the opening Central America sequence to the fight at Shrublands to the underwater sequences and motorbike chase, this is a film where the action sequences are not only great but service the plot as well for the most part. The film also sports good special effects in terms of cruise missile models, explosions, and all the things we expect from a Bond film. Irvin Kershner, then fresh off doing The Empire Strikes Back, brings a tight sense of direction to the film especially in sequences like the substation of nuclear warheads and the subsequent theft of the cruise missiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet this film is far from perfect. Never Say Never Again is easily one of the most dated of the Bond films with its heavy use of 1980\&#39;s computer sand video games. While technology dates any film after a time, this film\&#39;s heavy reliance on it, especially in the hijacking of the cruise missiles and the Domination sequence makes the film look incredibly dated some quarter of a century after its release. The script also tends to suffer from predictability due to the very fact it\&#39;s a remake of Thunderball.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet for its predictability the script for Never Say Never Again is pretty good. The script sports good dialogue scenes, not a single cringe worthy one liner (how many of the Roger Moore era scripts can you say that about?), some humorous situations, and yet is watchable and tense for the most part. Once you look past he fact that it\&#39;s a remake, there\&#39;s quite a lot of good things in the script for the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music is in fact the biggest weakness of the film. Due to the &#34;unofficial&#34; status of the film, the James Bond Theme could not be used. That said this could have shown with the right composer that a Bond score without it could work. Unfortunately Michael Legrand\&#39;s score is far from adequate. Legrand\&#39;s score is totally out of place in a Bond film and there is only of or two places where it actually works. To make matters worse the film is also lumbered with one of the worst title sequences ever to grace a James Bond film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite being heavily dated, somewhat predicable, and having a bad score Never Say Never Again is still a good Bond film. With one of the best casts of any Bond film, good action sequences, good special effects, good direction, and some terrific dialogue, this film proves that &#34;unofficial&#34; isn\&#39;t a bad thing. In fact it is is better then Octopussy and the winner of &#34;the battle of the Bonds&#34;.&#39;

b&#34;Jack Black and Kyle Gass team together to promote their band Tenacious D in this Rock Classic called Tenacious D In The Pick Of Destiny. Jack Black and Kyle Gass invent their own Rock Opera..it was like an Opera of Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll. Some of the most twisted events took place in that movie....the big foot part....the mushroom part....and in the end when they did the rock off against the Devil. A classic formed in Tenacious D....one of the best films I have seen in a long time. The last couple things I saw in the theater were stupid..but this movie rocks. This really made me laugh hard. The whole basis is Jack Black runs of to find his rock partner in Los Angeles. His partner is Kyle Gass and man who has always been bald. They work together to find this magic pick that can make the most terrible musician play greatly. They finally make it to the Rock &#39;N&#39; Roll Museum and steal the pick. On the way they meet The Stranger Played By Tim Robbins. They make it to the club to win their prize money when the owner grabs the pick and all along he was the devil and he battles the D in a Rock Off. The D doesn&#39;t win but the Devil&#39;s horn falls off sending him back to hell. Therefore LONG LIVE THE D!!!!!!!!!!&#34;

b&#39;Oh my god. Obviously, when you rent or buy this, you\&#39;re not expecting to see a documentary on the mating habits of small rodents in their natural habitats. You\&#39;re expecting a visual feast of blood and gore and and maybe even a scare or two. well, for those who are as sick and twisted as myself, you won\&#39;t find many scares, but you\&#39;ll come very close to urinating all over yourself in laughter. the catch phrases in this movie will stay with you and your friends forever. The first time i showed this to my friends and colleagues was over 3 years ago, but still we laugh our asses off and use the catch phrases. it\&#39;s as addictive and funny as Sam Raimi\&#39;s The Evil Dead II: Dead By Dawn and Peter Jackson\&#39;s Dead Alive/Braindead. From the opening scene\&#39;s absolutely ridiculous dialog, to the Splatter and Gore Department\&#39;s finest works, to the wondrous abilities of Ed the film cutter, you will laugh and laugh again. As far as the visual feast of blood and gore, oh yeah, they\&#39;ve got it. And they\&#39;re pretty damn good at it... &#34;The neck-bone\&#39;s connected to the head-bone...&#34; This film also may have done the best nightmare/hallucination/totally effing nuts scene i have ever seen. and that one\&#39;s not mean to be funny, but man is it well done (and creepy.) Overall, to anyone who is not against a bunch of blood and a damn good time, IF YOU EVER SEE THIS MOVIE GET IT!!!! it\&#39;s on Netflix, i know that for sure.&#39;

b&#39;My Santa Lucia Choir was chosen to be in this movie. All 100 plus. When it came time to film the movie I was asked to chose just 10. Oh my goodness. We had a little gal who went early to have her tonsils out because she wanted to be in the movie. The choices were hard to make. The people of Georgetown are just a lovely as the people that they show in the movie. Gracious, kind, believers. The town sponsors an annual Christmas Market the first two weekend in December every year. I was there this year and it was wonderful. The town is lovely and the people work hard to make it magical. The town appears today as it did when the movie was made. Much credit goes to the Historical Society there that work hard to maintain the historical value. The principal of the school that has been turned into a Charter School was given an award by the Governor of Colorado for Volunteers.&#39;

b&#34;Tim Burton is in essence an expressionist film-maker, disinterested in dimensions of character and obsessed with Gothic scope, opting for style over substance incessantly throughout his career. However, with his style being so poignantly endearing, I, like many moviegoers, forgive all the countless flaws that can be found in many of his movies and become engrossed in what are essentially, one hundred million dollar art films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s almost embarrassing for me to see a poetic, emotionally involving spirit within the second installment of a mediocre franchise, especially when that franchises target audience are half-witted 15 year old boys. Batman Returns should have been every bit as commercial as its predecessor, ensuring box office draw and cheap (in actual fact, very expensive) thrills, being entertaining without ever truly involving its audience. Had this been the result, then Tim Burton would have surely been required to direct a third installment. Instead, Burton delivers something that can only truly be defined by the phrase, &#39;out there&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the melancholy opening in which a high society couple throw a prison-like bassinette containing their newly born deformed baby into a river, it is clear that Batman Returns, ain&#39;t no picnic at Buckingham Palace. Cut to thirty three years later, during a political speech made by bad guy business tycoon Max Shreck (sinisterly portrayed by Christopher Walken), the Red Triangle Circus Gang attack Gotham City. Batman (Michael Keaton returning to the role) makes his first appearance sporting a new logo, eventually saving the day. Shreck is soon kidnapped by the circus gang and black-mailed into endorsing the political return of the baby, now a fully grown Penguin man (Danny DeVito in hideously perfect make-up), whose motives for return are suspicious only to Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, Shreck attempts to off his nosey and awkward assistant Selina Kyle (played perfectly by Michelle Pfeiffer who quite frankly deserved more recognition for her performance) who transforms into the deliciously sexy and psychotic Catwoman, out for revenge and harbours, for some unexplained reason, a deadly vendetta against the Dark Knight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batman Returns is bleak. The production design is breathtaking, delivering a cold haunting Gotham City with an even more apocalyptic feel than its predecessor. Danny Elfman&#39;s score supports the film brilliantly, ranging from invigorating to tragic. The tone and direction of the whole film itself is intensely brooding, shot like a sad nightmare, Burton&#39;s direction overshadows what is in fairness a diabolical screenplay with an almost totally irrelevant plot and yet at the same time perfect for Burton&#39;s visual style of film-making. And whilst Burton&#39;s action sequences struggle for exhilaration, the real excitement lies in the directional choices displaying the fall of each of its main characters, the Penguins demise, the Catwoman&#39;s mental state and Bruce Wayne&#39;s lonely destiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warner Brothers hated it whilst critical and audience reaction was mixed. After all, they wanted a Batman sequel, not a weird, somewhat ghastly horror movie, in which a deformed psychopathic orphan attempts to kidnap and drown a batch of babies, all-the-while vomiting what can only be described as green mucus. The production company wanted an audience friendly feature, something for the McDonald&#39;s clan to promote their happy meals with, not a movie of dire irredeemable characters, including a sexually repressed secretary who is pushed from a skyscraper and revived by a gang of cats awakening her from unconsciousness by chewing on her bloodied ice cold fingers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s easy to understand the mass disappointment that followed the release of Batman Returns. The film never felt like a Batman blockbuster. It is questionable if Burton really knew who Batman actually was or even if he cared about the character as much as he cared about the film fitting in with his usual themes of beautifully haunting art direction and misinterpreted, lonely characters who rarely conform with societies standards and expectations. This is why Burton failed to create a great Batman film. He did however; create a nostalgic and stunning, ballsy piece of cinema that remains a personal and nostalgic favourite of mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may not be a great Batman movie. But it is a great Tim Burton film.&#34;

b&#39;This was one of my favorite movies from childhood. I watched it so many times,eventually my tape wore out. I was a huge fan of this show and still am.The thing I love most about this movie is that it appeals to so many people, both young and old. I watch this movie now and laugh just as hard as I did the first time I saw it. I am now able to appreciate all the adult jokes that I never got as a child. My favorite characters are Elmyra and Foulmouth. Almost fifteen years later, my dad (a huge fan of the movie as well) and I are still quoting lines from this movie. I love the part where Foulmouth and Shirley go to the movies. &#34;You save the seats, Shirl and I\&#39;ll snag the dadgum snacks.&#34; I also loved the storyline of Plucky and Hampton and his family going to Happy World Land. Wade Pig reminded me a lot of my dad. I love the part when they finally get to Happy World Land and all they do is ride on the monorail. This movie is hilarious and appeals to children and kids. The animation, jokes and everything about it are top notch. If you have not seen it, rent it. You won\&#39;t be sorry.&#39;

b&#39;Emanuele Crialese did a fantastic job with one of those films that linger in the back of your mind for years. It was Respiro (see comments and synopsis here in IMDb).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, carrying the magnificent young talents he had for the first time on screen then, he takes the audience into a dark void. A literal plunge into dangerous waters. The subject is migration. In this case, from Italy to the New World (the name of the film). A big deal calling it for its American release &#34;The Golden Door&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story of a family that leaves everything and risks the rest -that is, their lives, for a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to spoil the show telling the story, so I\&#39;ll dwell a bit in the work Crialese and all his team did so brilliantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, choosing to stick to what he knows: direct sound as much as possible. This means, the whole film. The textures, the pain, the nuances of reality are always mingled with the smells, the heat or the cold, the sweat and the blood, life and death, as vibrantly as it is in real life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The squeaks of bent metal and grinding wood, the infamous drone of the wind and the ominous sounds of big engines and ship horns are among the points that make this film so involving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cinematography is in the hands of a French couturier. The symbolism of light is present from the very first shot (again, almost the very first shot from Respiro) and pervades throughout the film with intimacy and a terrible sense of desperation. The subdued tones and the very gray and grim depictions of people suffering the cramped and filthy boat they sail to hope is mesmerising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Light is used sparsely, almost to discover every character in the dark. The beauty of every shot, and every scene is accentuated by the period costumes and the perfectly selected physical features of the actors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, as he usually does, Vincenzo Amato is definitely on his own. He plays the father of two sons (the same actors who were fifteen and twelve and now are nineteen and sixteen) with all the power he always conveys to his very complex characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charlotte Gainsbourg is so-so. I guess she\&#39;s never achieved again the perfection she reached in The Cement Garden and in her very first film: L\&#39;Effront\xc3\xa9e.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it\&#39;s just that she seems a bit awkward in her role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The locations and sets are harsh and compelling, almost playing a character on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe the most remarkable character is the one played by Filippo Pucillo, the mute younger son. The contrast here with his first role is complete. Then, he played a supercharged kid that was as relentless as anything around him. Now, his character is all expression. And just that: no words at all. His eyes tell the whole story with sublime power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is one of those films that will not be very well received in the States. It\&#39;s absolutely Italian in everything. It\&#39;s so Italian that most of the time, the language is one of the many dialects that is much older than Italian itself. In the USA this film may be a bit too much for Americans because of the subject. But anyone who remembers the story of their families when they arrived in the States, will see this films with awe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, again, the minimalism that goes hand in hand with Crialese\&#39;s ideas is back with a closing scene in the water. Only this time it goes from underwater photography to aerial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, another great and very well told story from this filmmaker that only this year (2006) has collected 6 prizes and was nominated for the Golden Lion. Not a small deed!&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Mishima: A Life in Four Chapters&#34; is a visually stunning production that handles complex issues with evocative ease. It is based on the life of controversial Japanese author Yukio Mishima, who committed suicide in the 1970s. It is not really a biopic - at least not one in the traditional sense - but an exploration of Mishima\&#39;s iconoclastic oeuvre. The film succeeds in presenting abstract concepts in an unembroidered, totally engaging manner. Paul Schrader makes you sympathize with Mishima without having to deconstruct him or his work. It doesn\&#39;t quite solve the puzzle but it does make you understand it. An added bonus: As we see Mishima\&#39;s fury over the lack of tradition in a morally vacant modern society, Schrader gives us an excellent demonstration of the dichotomy between thought and execution in cinema. John Bailey\&#39;s cinematography is spectacularly good. The grandiosity of composer Philip Glass\&#39; work is perfectly suited for the project. &#34;Mishima&#34; is the best film I\&#39;ve seen this year, so far.&#39;

b&#39;Dragon Ma (Jackie Chan)is back, having rid the seas of the dreaded Pirate Lo. Back on land, he is assigned to the police force, where he is to clean up corruption and crime in a local suburb. Along the way, he is caught up in the fate of several Chinese patriots attempting to secure sympathy and support for their revolutionary cause. The Chinese Manchu government is after these revolutionaries, and anyone that stands in their way is in trouble, even if they are in the police force. I had big expectations for this movie after i saw Project A. But sadly I was a little disappointed. There is just too little action compared to the first film. There is just one good fight scene until the big ending. That fight scene is in the &#34;gangsters place&#34; and its good, a lot of people flying all over the place and hard kicks and punches are throw. Jackie Chan and his stunt team don\&#39;t disappoint here at all. The ending is very entertaining, Jackie Chan shows us why HE is the best stuntman in the world. Really exciting stuff! The only bad thing with the ending, is that the fights are too short and forgettable. Conclusion: Many funny moments, good acting and crazy stunts. But not enough fighting for a top rating.&#39;

b&#39;Black comedy isn\&#39;t always an easy sell. Every now and then you get a black comedy that is hugely successful, like Fargo, for example. But usually they don\&#39;t often find big audiences. People seem to either set their minds for comedy, or for serious mayhem. There doesn\&#39;t seem to be a big market for a good mixture of both. Throw Momma From the Train was a fairly decent hit, yet few people seem to remember much about it in this day and age. Danny DeVito just about hit this one all the way out of the park back in 1987.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DeVito plays an odd mamma\&#39;s boy named Owen looking to rid himself of his outrageously overbearing and unpleasant mother whom he still lives with. The mother is played by Anne Ramsey, who passed away shortly after this was released, and she is quite a caricature. She is loud, ugly, rude, and overbearing. Though Owen hardly seems like he could take care of himself, he wants desperately to have his mother offed. He fantasizes about it in some truly weird scenes, but he clearly doesn\&#39;t have the guts to actually do it himself. That\&#39;s where Billy Crystal comes in. Crystal plays Larry Donner, Owen\&#39;s creative writing teacher at a nearby community college. Larry is a paranoid would-be intellectual novelist who claims his ex-wife stole his novel and made millions off it. He is currently trying to write a new one, but cannot even come up with a decent first sentence. &#34;The night was....&#34; Owen hears Larry wish his ex-wife were dead during an outburst at the school cafeteria. And borrowing the idea from Strangers on a Train, Owen decides to travel to Hawai\&#39;i and murder Larry\&#39;s ex-wife. Once it appears he has done so, he expects Larry to return the favor and kill his mother. The resulting action is often quite funny, and even poignant. It\&#39;s certainly never dull and often full of surprises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is exceptional, even if Ramsey was a bit over the top. Crystal is as good as he can be, and DeVito has always been undervalued as a performer. The film relies on quite a bit of physical comedy which usually works, often painfully so. The film makes use of some truly innovative editing techniques in some scenes, and the off-beat tone is truly refreshing. I have often been critical of the late 1980s as being a time of artistic malaise and down right lazy film-making. Throw Momma From the Train takes chances. Both in how its characters are drawn as well as its general plot. How many comedies revolve around a son having his mother murdered? The film isn\&#39;t too long, and it is chock full of laughs. Writers are apt to find it more interesting than the general public, but it can still be enjoyed by just about anyone. 9 of 10 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Hound.&#39;

b&#34;Absolutely corrosive! Director Arthur Hiller and writer Paddy Chayefsky dismantle the American hospital system with this wicked comedy/drama/whodunit. The hospital depicted here is fraught with problems...from protesting neighbors to irate patients to a potential serial killer on the loose. George C. Scott is the top doctor who, on the brink of his own nervous breakdown, gets involved with free-spirited Diana Rigg and her wacky father Barnard Hughes. Alternately depressing and uproarious, THE HOSPITAL features some of the most acid-tinged dialog imaginable (note how Scott describes his love making session with Rigg). It also has a lot of great vignettes: Scott berating head nurse Nancy Marchand after one of here underlings accidentally kills a doctor; daffy administrator Frances Sternhagen trying desperately to collect insurance info from a waiting room full of sick people; Scott getting sobering advice from the hospital psychiatrist after telling him of his woeful home-life. All of the acting is first-rate. Scott and Rigg are dynamite and Hughes is a real surprise. The movie is a masterpiece with Chayefsky&#39;s script earning a well-deserved Oscar (over such stiff competition as KLUTE &amp; Sunday, BLOODY Sunday). The opening narration is priceless.&#34;

b&#39;I have fond memories of watching this visually dazzling film as a child in the late 70s/early 80s on wor-tv (now upn-9) in NY. Though a product of the swinging 60s, this film has hardly aged. The effects are just as wonderous as 2001, and in some ways superior (the model work is flawless). With an attractive cast, great color photography and set design, and an evocative score, JTTFSOTS is a winner!&#39;

b&#39;The first time I ever saw this movie was when I was four years old. I remember loving it and everything about it. 13 years later, I am now 17, and decided to watch it about a month ago because I am taking a 1960\&#39;s class in school. I didn\&#39;t really know what to expect, since it had been 13 years since I last saw it, but I was completely blown away by it. The actors were amazing, the music was so fun, and I now find myself singing along to every song. Treat Williams is great as Berger, the &#34;leader&#34; of the hippie group, who always gets what he wants, one way or another (except for at the very end, of course). John Savage is actually very convincing as Claude, the Oklahoma draftee who falls in love with Sheila (Beverly D\&#39;Angelo). D\&#39;Angelo is lovely as the prim and proper rich girl who eventually rebels against her upbringing and joins the hippies. The other hippies are played by Annie Golden, Don Dacus, and Dorsey Wright. Annie Golden is just adorable as Jeannie, the girl who is pregnant but still as cute and innocent as a child. Don Dacus and Dorsey Wright are good as Woof and Hud, the other two members of the group, and Cheryl Barnes, who plays Hud\&#39;s fianc\xc3\xa9e, has an amazing voice. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I have with this movie, however, is that the relationship between Claude and Sheila is not very convincing. They are barely ever shown together, and when they are, they fight (remember the skinny dipping scene?). It seems as though their relationship is very weak, and by the end of the movie we are supposed to believe they are madly in love, only based on the few meetings they had. I also see that many people writing reviews here are upset by the PG rating this movie has. I personally would raise the rating up to a PG-13, only because there is some drug use... but remember in 1979, PG-13 didn\&#39;t exist. I don\&#39;t think the nudity is bad at all, it is in no way sexual (in fact, there isn\&#39;t really any sex at all in this movie), and it is only to show the childlike innocence that the group maintains. In most European countries, nudity isn\&#39;t regarded as something bad, and I don\&#39;t see why it is here in the US. Anyways, I give this movie a high rating, and I\&#39;m glad it was made back then, because in the insanely &#34;politically correct&#34; world of today, they wouldn\&#39;t even think of making it, and even if they did, it would be a very &#34;watered down&#34; version, and I\&#39;m sure you wouldn\&#39;t get the full effect. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, this is a very underrated film that is definitely worth checking out.&#39;

b&#34;What can I say? I couldn&#39;t sleep and I came across this movie on MTV. I started watching it with every intention of changing the channel if it started to get lame as so many anti-drug movies do but I got sucked into this movie and I couldn&#39;t stop watching. Nick Stahl did an amazing job with his character, and in my opinion he really made the movie something worth watching. I was interested in purchasing the soundtrack to the movie (or even the movie itself) and MTV.com was no help at all, but believe it or not Amazon.com is taking pre-orders for the August 5th release of the movie on DVD. I know I had a hard time tracking it down, and I&#39;m sure other people might have had the same problem. I&#39;m buying my own copy so I can drool over Nick Stahl while bawling my eyes out at the same time thanks to the emotional storyline!&#34;

b&#39;On the whole one wishes this was a better film, but it has enough flashes of intense power to make it worth while. Peck made this film during the same period that he made The Gunfighter, before he apparently decided he was a monument rather than an actor. A pity! He was a fine actor, perfectly willing to tackle characters that were not very likable, and to do them extremely well. The character he plays here is driven and, when necessary, ruthless. Given the mission the character has been assigned, and the &#34;men&#34; with which to do it, those characteristics are essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without being a spoiler, think of this film as an early, grittier example of The Dirty Dozen genre. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialog in this film is a bit ham handed but it is atmospheric and intense and definitely tells a story worth telling. It contains good work by all the character actors and even Barbara Payton turns in a credible performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one isn\&#39;t often shown on television so your local video store may be the only place to find a copy. Go ahead! Devote an evening to it. It is worth your time!&#39;

b&#39;My top 2 actors happen to be in this film - Robert Ryan and Robert Mitchum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan could play anything from Shakespeare to Arthur Miller and play it magnificently. In this film when he starts his speech &#34;...people with names like Samuels and others with names that are hard to say&#34; - it is chilling to watch him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Young plays the policeman who is called to investigate the murder of Samuels (Sam Levine), a civilian, who is chatting with several soldiers in a bar. Mitchell is the soldier wanted in connection with it - his wallet has been found in the apartment. But Mitchell is a gentle soldier, who is only missing his wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told from different perspectives. Mitchell and Samuels strike up a friendship and go back to Samuels apartment. Samuels seems to know the loneliness that Mitchell is feeling. &#34;For years you have been concentrating on one peanut and now it is gone you don\&#39;t know what to feel&#34; he says about the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ryan is superb as Monty, the psychotic racist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Young (along with Dick Powell) was an actor whose career was re-juvenated by film-noir. &#34;Crossfire&#34;, &#34;They Won\&#39;t Believe Me&#34; and &#34;The Other Woman&#34; are great examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Mitchum is his usual laid back self as the philosopical Keeley.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gloria Graham and Paul Kelly as the &#34;odd couple&#34; are outstanding as well in their brief but telling roles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably the best film about racism ever made.&#39;

b&#34;At the beginning of this film, which I found myself watching on IFC in the wee hours of the morning, I was filled with a sense of claustrophobia and general discomfort. The feeling of being trapped with no way to escape was so powerful that I didn&#39;t know if I wanted to continue watching...although it didn&#39;t really seem to me that I had much of a choice, so compelling was the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gradually, though, that feeling of discomfort waned (although it never really disappeared entirely), and I felt drawn into Tessa &amp; Bobby&#39;s predicaments, and really just hoping against hope that they might get back together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really just a moving, powerful story fit snugly into a tiny package. I had no idea that Sarah Polley had anything to do with it until perusing her trivia, so now I love it even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend it. ...If your lucky enough to catch it on the Independent Film Channel sometime, or wily enough to figure out some other way to view it.&#34;

b&#39;many people have said that this movie was not a good movie, at a horror perspective i agree, it was not very scary, it did have some gruesome ways of torture yes (hooks going where they shouldn\&#39;t) but not scary. but it was a good movie at a comedic stand-point, i thought it was hilarious, such bad acting from dee snider with his stupid theological questioning and every second word he said came out as &#34;what is____, define______&#34;, then the angry mob at his house with one of them holding a sign saying &#34;we\&#39;re not gonna take it&#34; (which is a song from his band twisted sister. but i think the part that made me laugh the most was the one guy\&#39;s wife that was dead and dee snider was holding her up and making her dance, when i saw that i broke out in tears... so i would not recommend this for avid horror lovers, but for those who love horror for its comedy i recommend this movie 100%&#39;

b&#39;Inspired casting, charming and witty throughout. Much like the currency in the opening moments of the film, the story floats along magically until you are emotionally &#34;invested&#34; in its outcome. The city of Buffalo has never looked better! Kudos to the Burton Sisters and the entire cast for a job well done.&#39;

b&#34;Nice movie. At the begining, i thought it&#39;s a medieve detective kind hi-fi movie, but the ending totally surprised me. I guess, the whole movie covers too many subjects, each of them can be the main subject,e.g. avenge, friendship, and dream. But it mixed all of them without focusing on any of them. I think, it&#39;d be a great movie if it&#39;s built around the ending from the very begining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#34;just can&#39;t watch this bit too many times, it&#39;s full of true enthusiasm and cleverness Mickey Mouse had in his first 30 years. Nowadays&#39; Mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this. Steamboat Willie always makes me smile, at least the ending where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato. Animation is very nice and although steamboat Willie has no dialog, the music is enough for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMHO if this bit doesn&#39;t deserve 10/10 then any cartoon doesn&#39;t not only because it&#39;s a true classic, but also because it&#39;s so full of joy and it&#39;s always fun to watch.&#34;

b&#39;THE CELL fascinated me at first glance. I was a bit surprised about that fact, because the story of that movie is absolutely boring. If it had no story, the film would be better. Bunuels &#34;Un chien andalou&#34; comes to my mind- a film without story, but also with fascinating and sometimes disturbing images. But THE CELL is at first a Hollywood-Movie, and only second a piece of art. I\&#39;m very interested in Tarsem\&#39;s next project. Hamlet on Indian could be very interesting, especially when it has the same looks as THE CELL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For film music enthusiasts: Howard Shore\&#39;s score for THE CELL is absolutely marvelous, but a hard listening experience, because of its very modernistic style.&#39;

b&#34;It is well known that Irene Dunne could sing somewhat more than a little. And I think her talent as a comedienne can only be really understood once one has struggled through a sonata by Haydn or a song by Debussy and made a success of it. Her instrument is her voice and her handling of it is pure musicianship. She could tackle any part. The only thing she couldn&#39;t do was to not make a success of it. This film is a perfect example. In it, she channels Ruth Gordon (because the play is the thing), is feminine, charming, willful and self-effacing, generous, protective and combative but never pretentious. She manages to stay as believable as Alexander Knox is in another difficult role he assumes with aplomb. The viewer gets to believe in what he is seeing and to care for it. It is refreshing to see a film that is both entertaining and intellectually challenging while pushing all the right patriotic buttons. I sincerely hope the entire Dunne oeuvre makes it to DVD one day because it&#39;s really hard to keep a secret like that among just a few initiates.&#34;

b&#39;This documentary is as unique as it\&#39;s subject. And while D\&#39;Amato\&#39;s staple was erotica, the film manages to show some decent clips of the films you may remember from old time, late night Cinemax... One problem... Joe did hardcore porno at times mixed with softcore erotica, even mixed in his gore films. The gore films are cult classics, going for like $20 a pop for a dubbed copy on the net (not peanuts for 20 year old films, folks.) I want to see why those are cult classics. Also, as sweet as Joe seems (he did seem more elegant than one might expect,) the dude liked to shock. Both &#34;Caligula: The Untold Story&#34; and &#34;Emanuelle in America&#34; show us hardcore rape, snuff, and beastiality (in both, you\&#39;d be suprised how far he goes in &#34;Caligula II&#34; with that one, if you can track down an uncut print.) Although these scenes may be disconforting in a documentary of a persons career, hey, he did it... Also, I would have liked to see more interviews of people Joe worked with... Maybe that\&#39;s just me wanting to see what Laura Gemser looks like these days... I still think she\&#39;s a goddess and one of the sexiest women ever to grace the genre.&#39;

b&#39;The producers of this picture are Hungarians. It\&#39;s not by crazy artistic momentum that X and Z are capitalized in the titles considering that the word \&#39;isten\&#39; means \&#39;god\&#39; in Hungarian. - By the way, David, Isten is the word for God in Hungarian... - Hum... Is that so ? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s consider this movie as \&#39;A History Of Violence\&#39; science-fictional sibling. Both films have in common the strength of blowing up respective genres ; thriller and drama in the 2005 one and \&#39;none FX-ed as hell\&#39; science fiction in the one we\&#39;re looking at right now. Everything he does have a meaning and is surrounded by details : The nod to Phil K. Dick (who wrote &#34;In The Days of Perky Pat&#34;) by creating a \&#39;Perky Pat\&#39; fast-food restaurant. The nod to Stanley Kubrick by using 2001\&#39;s naming pattern ; as IBM became HAL (one letter down in the alphabet) in the 1968 movie, in eXistenZ \&#39;classic lubricant spray\&#39; WD-40 becomes XE-60 (one letter up) when Allegra cleans up Pikul\&#39;s port. The nod to David Cronenberg by using Videodrome\&#39;s witty kind of formula (\&#39;Death to...\&#39; &amp; \&#39;Long Live\&#39;..) and by taking another medium for central theme of a picture (tv in Videodrome, Video games and virtual reality in eXistenZ In 1983, you penetrated a TV set. In 1999, you\&#39;re penetrated by a game. Welcome to Canada!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nod to good taste by getting Peter Suschitzky\&#39;s cinematography, Howard Shore\&#39;s music and Ronald Sanders\&#39;s editing (a team that wins). For everyone born in the early 80\&#39;s with a super famicom, a genesis or an arcade stick in the hands, this movie rings a bell. Enough with the nods. The plot ? &#34;Jennifer Jason Leigh stars as a game designer (Allegra) who creates a virtual-reality game that taps into the players\&#39; minds&#34; as we can see on the movie main details page. That\&#39;s the story in the story. To me, this picture is about a \&#39;reality demonstrators\&#39; young couple infiltrating the \&#39;brand new virtual game\&#39; presentation session to destroy its programmer. I assume that what we see in the last five minutes is reality, if there\&#39;s such thing as reality. Jennifer Jason Leigh is always playing a game designer in the game they\&#39;re in and the end of the movie IS the reality, with video games freaks giggles, big hairy dogs, \&#39;Cronenbergy realistic\&#39; plastic textures (helmets and stuff) and 9mm handguns. What you see is true. They play transcendenz during an hour or so (in this game, there\&#39;s a game (eXistenZ) in which JJL plays eXistenZ\&#39;s genius programmer and Jude -Pikul - Law a marketing trainee associated with Allegra\&#39;s game), they play eXistenZ because Allegra is very concerned about her pod\&#39;s health (the thing you plug your nervous system in, in order to play), she has to plug herself and Pikul in then wins the game (Transcendenz) and back in the reality they kill Yevgeny Nourish, TranscendenZ programmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Playing eXistenZ and TranscendenZ is about facing your essence, face your subconscious while its creating a virtual reality you\&#39;ll have to overcome in unexpected ways to win the game (by playing the game, the girl playing Allegra, the \&#39;reality demonstrator\&#39; turns into Allegra, a \&#39;virtuality goddess\&#39;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What game would Heidegger have played to feel his abstract da-sein term ? To be truly engaged in the world ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what about Nietschze (Yes Friedrich, God is dead and you know what ? Willem Dafoe stands for him! - God, The Mecanic -) ??? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes we do construct a narrative for ourselves, and losing this thread we follow from one day to the next disintegrate people as personalities ; eXistenZ\&#39;s discusses the fact that reality is the whole perception of itself by anyone who engaged it truly. And we could sometimes get some neat stuff ; a perception of virtuality in virtuality in reality.&#39;

b&#39;Forget about Donnie Darko. I open with this because it seems that a good portion of the reviews I have read on The Box amount to the simple but weak argument that it doesn\&#39;t hold a candle to Darko. It isn\&#39;t that I disagree with that necessarily, I just feel that this movie is a different animal altogether and deserves its own analysis. There are points of comparison to be sure, but they are peripheral concerns when you consider that the key to the heart of each movie is different. In Darko, the driving force of the narrative is existential. In The Box, the driving force of the narrative stems from a moral dilemma. Believe me when I say that I understand the inclination to compare an innovative filmmakers\&#39;movies by looking for trends and patterns, but for me it is more important to approach each new film as a self contained entity first, and then broaden my gaze afterwards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Box is one of those films you get mixed feelings about because it seems to be in some sort of identity crisis. It isn\&#39;t always sure what it wants to be. The twists are numerous, but easy to follow if not to predict. James Marsden and Cameron Diaz play a relatively believable pair of newlyweds who are in financial straits. A Box containing a &#34;button unit&#34; arrives on their doorstep and they are informed by a horribly burned man that if pushed the button will cause the death of one person whom they don\&#39;t know, and they will receive one million dollars. One of the things The Box achieves is to conjure up this invisible fear that somewhere out there our actions have moral consequences. Before the button is pushed it has an eerie and seductive quality, alluring yet sinister. Once it has been pushed, events are set in motion that make the two leads question their own morality and deeply regret their fateful decision. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The notion that the Box is an experiment is interesting because for me it provides the movie with a paradox. If there are external beings developing an &#34;altruism coefficient&#34; based on data gathered by couples pushing and not pushing the button, then as the conspiracy unravels, we notice that ultimately it is a forced altruism: Be selfless or the species will be wiped out. I suppose the couples don\&#39;t know the consequences of their actions when they are faced with making the decision, but they have no reason to suspect that The Box can do anything, so why would they choose altruistically? Is altruism devalued by the fact that we only care about it when presented with a problem in our own lives? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The psychological hurdles in this movie are everywhere. Push the button or don\&#39;t, it\&#39;s likely someone is messing with you. Take the money or don\&#39;t, no one gives anything away for free. Search for the truth, the answers you find slowly reveal your demise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I propose that The Box is an ironic work because it offers the false choice of free will while revealing that we are trapped in many metaphorical boxes. You can only choose to be free at the expense of another\&#39;s life, is that freedom? No, it is only another box because then you become trapped in the consequences of your own morality. There is no escape for us because we live on earth and that is another Box. This is precisely why the external beings in the film are ultimately antagonists. They demand we conform to moral standards which rob us of our freedom. We made it to Mars, and we were burned for it and turned into slaves in a sick game. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The references to Jean Paul Sartre illustrate this point rather well. &#34;You can only enter the final chamber free, or not free.&#34; Sure, but no matter the form in which we enter the chamber, it is a chamber nonetheless. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trevor Nemeth&#39;

b&#39;This 1925 film narrates the story of the mutiny on board battleship Potemkin at the port of Odessa. The movie celebrated the 20th anniversary of the uprising of 1905, which was seen as a direct precursor to the October Revolution of 1917. Following his montage theory, Eisenstein plays with scenes, their duration and the way they combine to emphasize his message, besides he uses different camera shot angles and revolutionary illumination techniques. The &#34;Odessa Steps&#34; sequence in Potemkin is one of the most famous in the history of cinema. The baby carriage coming loose down the steps after its mother has been shot was later recreated in Brian d\&#39; Palma\&#39;s The Untouchables. It is clear that the film is one of the best ever made considering its time and how innovative it was though you need a little bit of patience and to be a real movie enthusiast to go through its 70 minutes.&#39;

b&#39;I have to hold Barney drilling my head every day; well.. I guess there must be reasons. First, I\&#39;m convinced that our kids are not stupids, they are just kids, but they know (my 1 and a half years old son &#34;selects&#34; what to see) what\&#39;s nice or disgusting. Did you see the news? Do you think your kids HAVE TO KNOW the reality as it is? Maybe..or maybe not; we (the adults) have the responsibility about what we want for our kids, and what to teach them. A film of drug dealers? news about massacres in Middle East? Of course, the kids must know there is a Real Life, but... they are kids; let\&#39;s give them some mercy. What do you want for them? If you wanna have kids trained on weapons or the best way to kill a neighbor, go ahead, impose them Lethal Weapon, Kill Bill, any manga\&#39;s anime, tell them Santa\&#39;s a depraved who enters through the chimney directly to violate them. I want illusions for my son (don\&#39;t get me wrong, I\&#39;m not saying Barney and Friends is the best; in fact, the show have a lot of defects, I read other comments and I agree with most); maybe the happiness is made of dreams, or illusions. At least, I want to teach him to grow WITHOUT FEAR BUT CAUTIOUS, that learns to think and believe that everything is not serial killers or hijackers, whom they\&#39;re reasons to worth to grow. That, at least, he can be a little happy with his own dreams. So, parents, don\&#39;t underestimate your kids; they know what they want.&#39;

b&#39;This is possibly one of my favorite films. It tells the tale of a girl named Gerda (Chelsea Hobbs) who lost her mother at a very young age, so has been bought up by her father. She falls in love with the bell boy named Kai. However, on her birthday the snow queen (Bridget Fonda) comes the the hotel which her father owns and kidnaps Kai. Gurda then goes after Kai, and follows him through the four seasons in an attempt to rescue him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought that this was an excellent adaption of the story with great performances from all the cast. It has wonderful special effects and the story fits together very well and is easy to follow. I think that it is a great film for all the family to enjoy. I have watched it every time t has been on since it came out and have never tired of it which is why I have given it a 10!&#39;

b&#39;What do you mean son of actor, not an actor. You don\&#39;t become an actor just because your daddy is a superstar---it doesn\&#39;t work that way, not in UK at any rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macbeth (this version) is a low budget Scottish movie. You can\&#39;t compare this to the Polanski version because Polanski has all the budgets in the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jason acted throughout school, but his big break came in 1985, when he landed the role of Robin Hood in Britain\&#39;s &#34;Robin of Sherwood&#34; television series. He has appeared in many films since then, including &#34;Shanghai Noon&#34; and &#34;Lord of the Rings 2\xe2\x80\xb3. Jason has since moved behind the camera, forming the production company, Unconditional Entertainment. He recently wrapped filming on his latest movie, which stars Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Ray Winstone. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And all this has nothing to do with being the son of Sean Connery. If you think Jason said to Sean, &#34;daddy, I wanna be in Macbeth movie that they are going to film,&#34; and Sean said, &#34;sure, son, whatever you say,&#34; and made a phone call and got his son the role, you are mistaken. In fact, Jason Connery is being cut out of his father\&#39;s will. Seeing as how his father is Sean Connery, that\&#39;s a big chunk of change Jason will be losing out on. The reasoning behind the decision is apparently Sean\&#39;s strong feelings that his only son should learn to provide for himself. The relationship has become fairly strained, with Jason even threatening to change his name. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------------ Of being the son of Sean Connery,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;I realize that I\&#39;m always going to be compared to my father. There are innuendos all the time. Should I spend my whole life justifying myself?&#34; ------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So stop being a jackass and accuse him of not being able to act just because he is son of Sean Connery (big deal!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch Jason in Bullet to Beijing and you\&#39;ll form a different opinion about his acting ability.&#39;

b&#34;This has to be one of the funniest movies I&#39;ve ever seen. The idea of a typical family leaving everything behind to live in the wilderness. When mom and dad both lose there jobs, not to mention they have green slime in their bathtub. They decide it&#39;s in their families best interest to move to Oregon. Once there everything goes wrong. An interesting cast of characters compliment this movie. Including a young Molly Ringwald,this a movie I would definetly recommend.&#34;

b&#39;My son, an avid skateboarder, sat me down and made me watch this with him. As I love documentaries, it didn\&#39;t take a whole lot of pressure on his part. The whole amazing story of it all - a bunch of dirt-poor kids drift together and end up creating something revolutionary out of thin air - well, more out of some wood, wheels and lack of waves to surf - it just floored me. It still does. I didn\&#39;t think I would enjoy it the way I did, nor did I think I would tear up watching Stacey Peralta tear up over the fate of Jay Adams. And just watching Jay Adams himself.....the sheer genius of the kid skating and the shrug of the adult remembering. I watched it again last night for what has to be the 10th time and I still get goosebumps watching him fly down the hill with Jimi Hendrix\&#39;s &#34;Freedom&#34; playing in the background. And I teared up, again. Not too many movies have the same impact with me after several viewings. Brilliant.&#39;

b&#34;A ham actor without a penny. Who better than Michael Caine to play such a character? He is totally and utterly hilarious but, as in most of Caine&#39;s performances, he goes for it for real. The film seems to be a showcase of Dylan Moran and he&#39;s splendiferous in his double act with Caine. This, however, is where the script falters. Moran&#39;s impersonations should have been incorporated in a rather more organic way. They are too much of an act on their own and makes the potential plausibility of the plot fly out of the window. Never mind. Get it if you can find it. There is enough in it to make it a pleasurable journey.&#34;

b&#34;Everyone who worked on this film did an AMAZING job. This is honestly one of the best lesbian films I&#39;ve seen in a LONG time. The acting, writing, cinematography, music, visuals, everything was top notch. As an avid fan of the genre (both lesbian films and gymnastics), I was so unbelievably pleased by this film. It truly gave me so much more than I expected across the board. Hearing the Q&amp;A with the cast and crew was great, the lead actress has so much positive energy and is so humble and gracious, it&#39;s a pleasure to see people who can be talented and not lose sight of what&#39;s really important. And the writer did a hell of a job, as well as directing and the editing was awesome. Thanks so much for making a great film! Thanks also for the line about &#39;if you&#39;re going to slap a label on yourself, it would be bisexual&#39;. I&#39;m so tired of movies where characters who have a relationship with both sexes get passed off as gay or straight, it&#39;s wonderful to see bisexuals getting recognition for existing and being part of the gay community, and it was nice that labels weren&#39;t even necessary at all in this film. What an ending! Just when I thought it couldn&#39;t give me more, it did. Beautiful work and my applauds to all. I will spread the word, this is definitely a film not to be missed!&#34;

b&#39;William Shakespeare\&#39;s plays are classified as comedy, tragedy, or history. Some of his most memorable --and most often read -- creations provide us with wistful humor, gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick. Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity. Regardless, he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness, contributing greatly to our young language. So in what category lies The Merchant of Venice ? I was very surprised to find it is one of Shakespeare\&#39;s comedies. I had never before read it nor seen it, but after watching this most recent film version I have decided it is neither and it is both. This is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a perplexing and deeply troubling moral tragedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The players are introduced quickly, and simply. One of them, firstly, is Venice itself; director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city, creating an impressively vibrant, bustling backdrop to the play\&#39;s proceedings. To this scenery enters the youthful Bassanio (Joseph Fiennes), returning to Venice to see a dear old friend, Antonio (Jeremy Irons). It seems the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts. Waiting at the fair lady\&#39;s island estate are three small trunks, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;only one of which contains &#34;images of the princess&#34;. He who can guess the right one, using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written upon them, will be bestowed the father\&#39;s huge fortune for life. Oh, and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage, I forgot to mention. Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the movie. This farcical plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the film\&#39;s screen time, as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island, humorously vying for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage. But before any of this occurs Bassanio, very much lacking in finances, entreats Antonio to loan him three thousand ducats to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antonio, himself nearly penniless, must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking the financial aid of Shylock (Al Pacino), one of countless Jewish usurers who keep the sagging economy afloat yet are scorned and persecuted to no end by the city\&#39;s zealously Christian majority. Thus they dwell in society\&#39;s underbelly, and it is here the two borrowers must go. Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where Antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market, and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help. But help him Shylock does. He even erases any kind of interest on the loan, most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if Antonio will be able to repay him within three months. Still, Shylock\&#39;s one contractual demand is a pound of Antonio\&#39;s flesh, should he renege on their agreement. This is an unsettling request, to be sure, for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us. But it appears that despite his justifiable pride Shylock does not really anticipate seeing such a gruesome act occurring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here the dramatic groundwork has been laid. And while the film goes off to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and mistaken identities, there still looms the gloomy prospect of the loan itself. In the end, what will become of this ominous agreement? Meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of Shylock. Al Pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here, and he does so with convincing grit and passion. There are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor. But his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy, showing a conflicted personality: honest, sincere, and proud, yet brooding, vengeful and entirely remorseless. This is one of Pacino\&#39;s most heartfelt performances to date. And while the rest of the cast play their roles creditably and convincingly, it is Pacino who really owns the film -- especially toward the end, when Shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third act.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shall not reveal much here; all I can say is that it involves the initial loan -- a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later. And does it ever. By the end Shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience: seemingly unresolvable questions of faith, morality, law, and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes, and while by curtain\&#39;s close the playwright\&#39;s position may seem clear to some, we are left completely at odds. There are winners and losers in this one, but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason, or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well? Has virtue been rewarded, or simply flouted? Has justice in fact this time been just? By the play\&#39;s finish some fates are painfully clear, and unequivocally sealed. But the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved. And for some the verdict is still out for the play as well. Comedy or tragedy? The author has cunningly veiled the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light mirth and pat romantic resolutions. Is he saying that all is well that ends well, or is this his final, ironic condemnation? The play\&#39;s humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash. And while it is also what unfortunately keeps The Merchant of Venice from achieving the greatness of so many of Shakespeare\&#39;s other works, it is still engaging, amusing, and thought-provoking beyond measure.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;ll make this brief. This was a joy to watch. It may or may not have been more effective if the characters had resembled their real life counterparts, but aside from this minor observation I found the fantasy animal characters to be most enjoyable. The visuals were most stunning except for the second-rate CG scenes, which could have been left out. I dislike computer generated animation anyways, it defeats the purpose of a biopic such as this one. Watch it, you will appreciate it too!&#34;

b&#39;After working on 7 movies with director Mickael Curtiz (The Adventures of Robin Hood are their best achievement), Errol Flynn got tired of his dictatorial direction and decided to work with the great Raoul Walsh. This reunion is a happy thing for cinematography. THE DIED WITH THEIR BOOTS ON is their first and best film together. Raoul Walsh portrays the General George Armstrong Custer (Errol Flynn) from his debuts at West Point, to the Civil War and finally at the battle of Little Big Horn. It\&#39;s true the film shows a too heroic portrait of Custer, but that\&#39;s not important. What is important, is the fact that we are transported with the passion and glory carried by the characters. Who can forget California Joe, the great &#34;Queen\&#39;s Own Buttler&#34; with his song &#34;Garryowen&#34;, the touching Mrs Custer (Olivia de Havilland), the diabolic Sharp well played by Arthur Kennedy ?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An eternal blow remains on this epic and tragic freso.&#39;

b&#39;The cover of the VHS says it all: &#34;Without doubt, the most powerful movie of its kind since the Texas Chainsaw Massacre&#34;. I\&#39;m a huge fan of 70\&#39;s and 80\&#39;s slashers and I have to say, I agree 100 %. The characters are believable, the actors have an excellent charm (especially George Kennedy as the forest-ranger). There\&#39;s the twisted atmosphere, that only TCM has, an astounding soundtrack to reflect the emotions and the filming locations that are the most beautiful in the history of horror. This has to be one of the most beautifully shot horror films of all time! Jeff Lieberman as a director of this 1981 low budget film does and excellent job and with his other works (Blue Sunshine, Wrong Turn) added, he must be one of the most underrated directors in the filmindustry today.&#39;

b&#34;This is a love story set against the back drop of television news. The three main stars, William Hurt,Holly Hunter and Albert Brooks create a love triangle whilst working at the Washington bureau of a TV network.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Grunick(Hurt)is the handsome reporter who is being groomed to be a star.Jane (Hunter)is the producer who recognises that Tom lacks the intellectual gravitas to be a real journalist, but falls for him anyway.Aaron Altman(Brooks)is the man who shares her beliefs in journalistic standards is also the man who truly loves her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly Hunter was nominated for a Best Actress Academy Award ,but lost out to Cher(Moonstruck!).She was robbed! This is Hunter&#39;s film.Her character Jane is smart,ruthless and totally driven. She is also hilariously neurotic. Her performance is perfect.Just watch her face when she watches the tape of Tom&#39;s interview of a rape victim. The scales literally fall from her eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wiliam Hurt&#39;s performance is less showy.He plays a man who is well aware that he is a himbo and a fraud,but is smart enough to know that his rise will be facilitated by people like Jane.He gives little hints of a man who is extremely calculating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film comments on celebrity, journalism,integrity and the commercial pressures on news in a medium that is focused on the bottom line. It predicted that news would be dumbed down, that standards would slowly be lowered due to commercial pressures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about this:this film was released before the end of the Cold War and before rise of reality TV.Yet, it predicted the dumbing down of the news.Paris Hilton&#39;s release from jail was treated like a major news story! To see how prophetic this film is,just watch your evening news and note the set, the graphics and the presenters.Tom Grunick and his clones are well and truly alive!&#34;

b&#39;This is a perfect movie to watch with a loved one on a cold and snowy night. If you like a few laughs with your horror then this is the movie for you. The makings of a real cult classic. It has everything you would want to see in a horror movie. A beautiful girl, A hero, The buffoon, A MONSTER TRUCK and of course a family of mutant satanic killers. This one is full of blood,guts and gore. I strongly recommend watching this one in the wee early morning hours, and be careful of who sees you being entertained by the sounds of Monster trucks, Bad {But Funny } One liners and our Hero eating eye ball stew. Not as good as the Evil Dead but a close second. Just remember WARNING..... Do NOT EAT BEFORE VIEWING THIS FILM...&#39;

b&#39;I agree with another reviewer, this is such a shattering film, that will be tough to watch again soon, though for quality alone, it deserves repeated viewing. The complexity of the characters, the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is one scene, of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol, that\&#39;s perhaps, for sheer physicality, the most amazing performance I\&#39;ve ever seen. In fact, though not episodic -- the story flows -- this is a movie of memorable scenes. There\&#39;s the passing of rations amongst the partisans, the snow scenes, the ruined farm scene, the encounters in the houses, the interrogation, the &#34;basement&#34; scene, the &#34;ascent&#34;. All stand out like jewels in a necklace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, the religiosity isn\&#39;t overt. Frankly, I don\&#39;t think it would have been permitted in a Soviet film. I do see this as an existential parable about the value of life. Here is a tale where the hero -- and he is a true hero -- becomes the villain, and the weaker one becomes the stronger one. Is this a mystical process or one dictated by circumstances? There is a transfiguration, but does it come from within or without? You must see the movie to understand the issues, for they can\&#39;t be discussed without giving away too much of the story. I can\&#39;t say enough about the acting. It\&#39;s hard for me to choose which of the leads is more affecting. I\&#39;m not familiar with Soviet film of the 70s and am not familiar with any of the actors, but they are all superb. I also note how director Larisa Shepitko uses children. They remind me of Giotto\&#39;s child angels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a little muddling in the end. There is apparently a prior relationship between the soldier Sotnikov and the interrogator Portnov, but this is left dangling. And the final scene is a bit ambiguous. But compared to the total experience these are quibbles. This is a movie that will mark you for life.&#39;

b&#34;Raoul Walsh&#39;s mega-epic, stunning filmed in an early widescreen process by the great Arthur Edeson, can be slow and static in the early talkie manner, but this classic wagon train journey across America to the NorthWest is thrilling as a sheer physical production when seen on the big screen. On t.v., the lack of close-ups and distant sound reproduction may prove daunting. Young John Wayne scores easily in his first starring role with a natural delivery the rest of the cast can&#39;t command. Amazingly, the film flopped and Wayne spent most of the following decade in Grade B Western fodder.&#34;

b&#39;This was a movie that, at the end, I thought &#34;Now that was an enjoyable 2 hours!&#34; I hate spending around $20 (not including baby-sitting $$) for my husband and myself to have that &#34;It was OK&#34; feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like Will Smith better as a comedic actor than an action hero. He was well cast in this. His character was very likable, as was Kevin James\&#39;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were several laugh out loud scenes. It\&#39;s also a romantic movie, so guys, if you want to impress the lady in your life, take her to this. Women will like it as much as any chick-flick, but I wouldn\&#39;t categorize this as one. There is plenty of guy humor in it for men to enjoy. I think that\&#39;s one of the reasons why this movie is so perfect as a date movie. It has romance AND slapstick. I don\&#39;t usually like slapstick that much, but it wasn\&#39;t overdone and I can\&#39;t think of any those scenes that didn\&#39;t deliver laughs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this movie. The first thing my husband said to me after it was over was &#34;I want to see it again!&#34;&#39;

b&#39;Flowers! If it\&#39;s one thing you\&#39;ll take away from this movie, it\&#39;s gonna be the flowers. They feature so prominently and are used as plot devices, you\&#39;ll become an expert in identifying with daisies and black tulips by the time the movie ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Amsterdam, Daisy tells the frustrating love triangle story between 1 girl and the 2 men in her life. One a professional hit-man eking out a living, the other an Interpol agent. Featuring a Pan-Asian cast (Korean, Hong Kong) and crew (director Andrew Lau from Hong Kong, writer from Korea, and a Thai post production team), I could imagine the headaches in coordination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Park Yi (Jung Woo-sung) is a hit-man who found a soft spot for painter Hye-young (played by the pretty Jeon Ji-hyun). It\&#39;s love at first sight in the meadows of daisies, where her clumsiness caught his attention. However, being shy and ever mindful of the dangers of his professional career, he can only admire her from afar, do little (or perhaps big) things for her in an anonymous fashion, but the one that takes the cake is sending her potted daisies everyday without fail at 4:15pm. He becomes her guardian angel from afar, shielding her and keeping her safe from harm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hye-young is in love with this mysterious stranger. She is constantly waiting for him to appear, but I really wonder how difficult could that be given the almost punctual daisy delivery. Nonetheless, she\&#39;s terribly moved, and touched by this sole act. However, as the stars would have it, interpol detective Jeong Woo (Lee Sung-jae) chances upon Hye-young at a town square during one of his undercover missions, and he too is captivated by her. In a similar fashion, because of his profession, he is doubtful if he should make the first move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is where the audience would find it frustrating. The lady obviously would fall for the wrong guy (then again, it\&#39;s the &#34;good&#34; guy), Park Yi being infuriated by Jeong Woo\&#39;s pursuit, but yet still refuses to step out and identify himself, and Jeong Woo being the opportunist in grabbing the free anonymous identity unwittingly. It\&#39;s almost as if you wanna give everyone a slap to wake them all up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, it is precisely this tension that keeps you intrigued. And it is wickedly fun to watch the two male leads finding it tough to fall in love without jeopardizing their careers, or their loved one. But fret not action fans, there are enough cat-and-mouse revelations and unsaid camaraderie in the mould of Infernal Affairs, as well as ample gunfights, although I felt the ending could have been scripted tighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What rocks is the clever editing. Telling the story in a non-linear timeline (no worries, it ain\&#39;t that bad, you\&#39;ll still be able to follow the narrative) from the points of view of all the leads, keeping you in suspense, and culminating in a three way split screen showcasing all their emotions in a single converging event, which I thought was extremely well-done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s a beautiful film in terms of landscapes of lush meadows and busy city squares, with plenty of classical music to sooth the soul. As with romance movies, all the leads are eye candy - the girls will have a field day with the two handsome male leads, while the guys have to make do with a somewhat pudgy-faced (argh! OK lah, at certain angles) Jeon Ji-hyun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;re into a romance movie with an equal balance in the action/tension department, then Daisy would be your choice. If you prefer a more conventional weepy, then the other Korean movie making its debut here at the same time, You are My Sunshine, would be your alternative. And yes, I totally dig the ending scene, which I thought only the Koreans do it best? Kinda reminded me of the JSA one.&#39;

b&#34;It is movie about love,violence,illegal affairs and romanian tycoons. A romanian story combined with an occidental adaption resulting in a modern international film that can be understood both by western audiences but as well by eastern European audiences that HAVE LONG forgotten about the conservative comunist regim over film-making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A film full of violent fight scenes that are very numerous and create more and more tensed situations as the movie goes on . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A story that impresses because of its view over the hard life from the neighbourhood. Two young men do illegal car races. They work together as a team and prosper from their occupation ,but when they are asked by a local tycoon to lose one race things start to get messy and the fuse from the bomb lights up creating a very tensionated movie that will keep you close to the screen until the ending of it when you will still be asking yourself a lot of questions long after that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brilliant acting both by Dragos Bucur and Dorina Chiriac along with high quality directing and screen writing by the young but talented director Radu Muntean also give a unique charm to Furia. All this and many other elements that can be noticed while watching have created a must see movie by all the filmlovers around the world and its message is clear to all not depending of race ,language we speak or country. It is a real hope for the Romanian cinema as it tries to keep up with the more advanced occidental cinema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope you enjoy watching it as I&#39;m sure that all the people that have seen it liked it and understood it.&#34;

b&#39;The 221 episodes of &#34;The Lone Ranger&#34; were originally broadcast on ABC from 1949 to 1957; and then for many years they played in local syndication. For most of the original broadcast years the series was ABC\&#39;s most watched piece of programming. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new DVD set from Pop Flix contains the first 16 episodes (15 Sept-29 Dec 1949) and for some reason unknown to me episode 22 from the fifth season, for a total of 17 episodes (the same 17 available on last year\&#39;s Mill Creek Entertainment release so these are probably in the public domain). These sets pretty much render &#34;The Legend of the Lone Ranger&#34; movie superfluous as all three episodes that were combined in 1952 to form the movie are included in these releases. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early episodes hark back to radio as there is considerably more voice-over narration used as an introduction and to introduce key plot moments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The series itself was pure kiddie western with clear-cut good and evil distinctions and no romance. The title character (played by Clayton Moore) started out Texas Ranger John Reid. The first three episodes provide the background for his transformation to Lone Ranger status, his partnering with the Indian Tonto (Jay Silverheels), and the taming of his horse &#34;Silver&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is an unambiguous code of positive morality infusing each episode. The Lone Ranger is totally good but he adopts the guise of evil. While a masked man in the west was normally feared by the good citizens and an Indian was distrusted, the Lone Ranger is feared by those who would do evil. One persistent theme is that when the Lone Ranger and Tonto first encounter an average citizen they are greeted with suspicion, and by the end of the episode the citizen has been convinced of their value. The trademark ending was a secondary character asking the question: &#34;who was that masked man?&#34;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To really enjoy the series you must accept it for the simplistic morality tale it was intended to be. If you don\&#39;t take it seriously and keep wishing for some self-reflexive campy parody elements you will only get frustrated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again, what do I know? I\&#39;m only a child.&#39;

b&#39;I saw this film via one of the actors\&#39; agents, and it surely conforms with a great deal that comes out of Sth. Australia in terms of the overall *tone,* which is rightly dark and moody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the little boy in the film was excellent. Mostly kid actors are *hammed up* and embarrassing but not in this case. He was really very good. In terms of the *surrealism* thingy mentioned by jingo, well, I just think this film is plain \&#39;weird.\&#39; It\&#39;s a real weirdo film, with weirdo locations, storyline, weird stuff going on the whole time. But \&#39;good\&#39; weird as opposed to \&#39;bad\&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its hard to think of other movies like it, but its not at all like CARS ATE Paris, maybe more like a REPULSION, but actually I think more like a Hammer movie from the 60\&#39;s. Its certainly has an interesting mind working behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JINGO, My question is also about the title. Why Modern Love?? Anyone? Also, jingo, what did you mean by &#34;god Forsaken&#34; when you were talking about Australia, hmmm? Just curious&#39;

b&#39;OK. Who ever invented this film hates humanity and wants to see them all slit their throats. This &#34;film&#34; was absolute and utter filth. What the heck was up with the weird old bags eyes? Seriously, was she on some sort of horrible drug and then she like just thought she could control people? She was running around with her freaking evil eye and it was like what? Do I have a booger hanging out of my nose? What are you staring at? Are you like the sea witch or something? All and all though I thought the graphics were top notch old chap. For that alone I would give it a ten. But just cover your ears when you are watching it. The pure and complete evil that comes from that film will make your ears bleed and your eyelids fall off. Who knows? You might even get a knot in your small intestine. You better watch out fools.&#39;

b&#34;Not bad but could be loads better, also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama. You&#39;ve got Sandra Bullock as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others, you&#39;ve got her placed with a new partner. There&#39;s a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway, and there&#39;s so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to scream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath. It&#39;s gripping and the subplots worked for me. Well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase.&#34;

b&#39;Even though the story is light, the movie flows so beautifully and its visual so tranquil and poetic that it could almost carry the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film consists of four interconnected stories, all about different aspect of attraction between man and/or woman and how it frequently is ethereal. Their true desire seems to be always something that they cannot hold onto, it will flow out like a handful of sand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the most intriguing story was the last one where the more unattainable the woman was, the more the man desires her. It parallels her deep love for god, who is infinitely out of reach, but never closer to her heart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A very good movie. 7/10&#39;

b&#34;this show is the best it is full of laughs and Kevin James is the best so if you want a good show i recommend the king of queens and its a letdown that they canceled it so in the end this show will make you forget your worries and troubles cause if you have a cast with Kevin James and jerry stiller you cant go wrong. so i don&#39;t know why the canceled the show if any one knows please tell me.now a days you cant find a lot of shows that fulfill your needs as an audience.after Seinfeld and king of queens the only show worth watching is prison break and if that stops i don&#39;t know what to do. in the end if i had to recommend a show it will be king of queens.&#34;

b&#34;Of course I&#39;m a bit prejudiced but for the time it was the most accurate portrayal of Marines ever shown on the big screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was at Camp Pendleton undergoing infantry training when Webb brought his crew down to film some outdoor scenes and our company was asked to participate. It took about two or three days as best I can recall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Webb and Don Dubbins were serious and businesslike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the filming of our short scene--which seemed to take forever to an 18 year old--Webb was very conscientious about getting things (Marine things) right and he did a good job with one exception--that scene where a recruit was wearing sunglasses. Never happen for a host of reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a video of the movie and will bore my grandkids anytime I can make them sit still for a few seconds as I show them their Papaw when he was a young stud and part of the world&#39;s greatest fighting force (no brag, just fact).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What amazed me then was how well the real Marines carried out their acting roles. That was before I realized that DIs have to have some acting genes to get their job done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only film I&#39;ve seen since that is the equal of the DI is the first half of Full Metal Jacket and that part is superior only because of the foul language. When the DI was made, cursing wasn&#39;t allowed on screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lack of profanity, it&#39;s still a great movie to rent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ooooo-rahhhhhh!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semper Fi, Do or Die&#34;

b&#34;From start to finish, this 1926 classic two reeler from the Hal Roach Studios seems to sum up what was fun about the 20&#39;s. It stars the now forgotten comic genius, Charley Chase and was directed by the legendary Leo McCarey, who was unknown then but would earn his keep with Roach and graduate to greener pastures in the 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s. Recently released onto video and disc, this is one of the ten best examples of silent screen comedy and should be seen by audiences of all ages. Although today his star has virtually diminished, Charley Chase was considered the leader in the short subject comedy field in the waning years of the silents. He helped the careers of Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy before they were brought together as a team, Leo McCarey and a host of other talents. It is a shame that he is all but remembered today. Check out this little gem of a film. Once you do, you will be seeking out other films from this classic comic. He had his hand in over 300 films and many of them survive. Rediscover this lost giant of a film from a bygone era and its giant star.&#34;

b&#39;Typically Spanish production - slow-moving, but with great sensuousness and sexuality oozing from the lead actress Paz Vega. (Watch her in &#34;Spanglish&#34;). Great sets, lots of colour - you get to see Cordoba, Seville, Spanish mountains and countryside. The plot tends to meander here and there, but if you follow closely (I managed to, even though the film is in Spanish), you\&#39;ll get the gist of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s about how one very highly sensual young Gypsy woman, Carmen, uses her feminine wiles to seduce men to do her bidding. Carmen is being taken to prison after attacking a fellow cigarera at the cigar factory where she works. She persuades Jose, the soldier in charge of taking her to prison, to let her escape. Jose succumbs to her charms because she speaks Basque (he is Navarrese and speaks the same language). Jose is punished by 1 month in jail and demoted to foot soldier. He later meets Carmen at a party and they end up becoming lovers. But Carmen refuses to commit to him, and continues her lascivious and flirty lifestyle. In a jealous rage, Jose kills a fellow soldier who has been with Carmen. They then have to leave town. Life on the run turns Jose into a bandit. Carmen, meanwhile, remains the same, a wildly promiscuous woman. In the end, Jose loses his mind and ends up killing Carmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is told by Jose in prison, awaiting to be executed. The person he tells the story to is Prospero Merrime, a French writer and anthropologist, whose fancy watch (it plays Beethoven\&#39;s Fur Elise) was stolen by either Carmen or Jose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth watching for the sets and for the delectable Paz Vega.&#39;

b&#39;This film is an excellent teaching tool as a pre-study of &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird.&#34; In conjunction with a study of the novel itself, &#34;...Caged Bird...&#34; can be used as an independent literary study or as an introduction to TKM.&#39;

b&#39;This film is titled &#34;Junior Pilot&#34; here on IMDb but &#34;Final Approach&#34; at Netflix. Go figure! The movie is a delight for both the target youth audience and for adults who can suspend their maturity long enough to watch this film through the eyes of their own youth. For the adult, the story is quite predictable, and perhaps trite and melodramatic; whereas the tale may seem new and creative to youngsters who have not yet seen or read many films or books with such a story line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In any case, credit must be given to the film\&#39;s creators, particularly the director James Becket and the cinematographer Denis Maloney, for making this most entertaining and visually interesting film. The cut-aways to the young protagonist Ricky\&#39;s fantasy thoughts are hilarious as well as delightfully filmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The young actors give uniformly believable performances, seemingly quite invested in their roles--silly as many scenes are. Jordan Garrett plays the protagonist &#34;Ricky&#34; with quite well, having excellent camera presence. Jeffrey Tedmori creates a delightfully soft and sensitive &#34;Shashi&#34; who of all ridiculous things thrives on hot sauce. Skyler Samuels and Adam Cagley give solid performances as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As is typical of his always fine acting, Larry Miller creates a solid parental figure around which the children\&#39;s part-real, part-fantasy world revolves. Compared to his father-figure, the other major adult roles appear to be shallow and one-dimensional, intentionally and quite humorously so, to be sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie is a simplistic youth-targeted story, of course, yet it is quite entertaining, perhaps repeatedly so to the targeted youth crowd, but also for at least one viewing by adults who retain the ability to view such a film from their once-youthful perspective.&#39;

b&#39;In the &#34;goofs&#34; section for this film there\&#39;s a comment to the effect that there is a mistake in continuity where Auguste\&#39;s car is seen to be parked in a different place from that seen in a previous shot in the same scene. This is incorrect. One of the views is from Auguste\&#39;s flat, the other is from Valentin\xc3\xa9\&#39;s flat across the street. The whole purpose of this segment is to show how Valentin\xc3\xa9 and Auguste - who may be made for each other - almost cross paths (as happens several other times) but never quite do so, until circumstances throw them together on the ferry at the end of the film. (And here there is the implication that Joseph has manipulated things so that Auguste is on that ferry, having inspected Valentin\xc3\xa9\&#39;s ticket to see which sailing she is booked on.)&#39;

b&#39;Gamers: DR is not a fancy made movie, it\&#39;s more like amateur video. Horrible magic effect, really fake fireball, terribly made dungeon, castle, village...... sword, axe, shield, robe, plate..... okok... everything. You will need about 10 minutes to adjust your expecting on visual, then you will get 105 minutes of fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m from Hongkong and it\&#39;s really hard to find RPers, none of my friends play RPG and I always fancy to be one of the character in the world of D&amp;D. Watching Gamers: DR just show me what would it be like to be a gamer. You see rule books, dices, game set, etc etc etc; You hear terms like &#34;fighter&#34;, &#34;wizard&#34;, &#34;hit point&#34;, &#34;level&#34;, &#34;character&#34;, &#34;flaming hand&#34;, &#34;Chaotic Evil&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What RPG fancy me is that it let you do anything u want to, not bonded by software RPG. Gamers: DR provide the same element, you wont know what happen next and it probably just make you laugh to dead. The movie goes both gamers\&#39;s real life as well as in the D&amp;D world. You will hear the gamer cast the dice when the character in game take action, which make you feel you really participle in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t want to spoil anything, but in short, Gamers: DR is a must watch movie for RPG lovers. For people never play RPG game, I\&#39;m sure you still get many fun from it.&#39;

b&#34;Scooby Doo and the Monster of Mexico was no doubt the weakest of the modern Scooby Doo animated features. Loch Ness Monster is a considerable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time the gang head off to Scotland to see the Highland Games and visit Blake castle, Daphne&#39;s ancestral home. And wouldn&#39;t you know, the castle happens to be in the &#39;quaint&#39; fishing village of Drumnadrochit, on the shores of Loch Ness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During their stay they meet a few interesting folks. First there is Fiona Pembrooke, a scientist who has drowned all of her money into finding the Loch Ness Monster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sir Ian Locksley, the boss of the National Heritage Museum of Scotland, he is staunch non-believer of Nessie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Haggarts, the own a cozy Inn on the shores of the loch. The sons are a couple of local jokers, always into mischief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Del Chilman, a wild, paranoid hippie dude who is convinced the monster is out there and will stop at nothing on find her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, Duncan MacGubbin, the dock master who has seen Nessie too many times to count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of these characters are stereotypes, which gets a bit annoying as this is teaching younger audiences a load of crap and giving the wrong impression. However if you can immune yourself to it you&#39;ll be alright. Being from Scotland I can&#39;t help but wince at the awfully mimicked Scottish accents. Fact: We DON&#39;T sound like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon enough Nessie, looking rather more demonic than &#39;usual&#39;, shows up and causes havoc. Looks like the gang have another mystery on their hands. The usual chase scenes, clues and Shaggy&#39;s wacky disguises follow. There are plenty of laughs. The animation is splendid, with some atmospheric scenes and locations. And the plot a lot better than Monster of Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing this time around is the music. I miss Louis Febre&#39;s scoring and the songs here are pretty rotten too. Where are the Hex Girls when you need &#39;em?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The region 2 DVD is in crystal clear 1.78:1 anamorphic widescreen (the region 1 ain&#39;t) with Dolby 5.0 sound. Some okay extras are included. Definitely worth getting.&#34;

b&#34;This was an excellent show. It came on PBS back home in Chicago and I remember Cindy Herron (From EnVogue) played the teen aged daughter. The show dealt with subjects such as sex, peer pressure and puberty. IT was about a middle class black family who had a teen aged daughter and son who moved to a middle class neighborhood from Oakland or somewhere (I can&#39;t remember). I remember several episodes but the one I remember most was when their cousin got her period for the first time. I was probably 7-8 when I first watched it and I was able to keep up with the program. This was a great show. I can&#39;t remember the name of the guy who played the son on the show, but I always got him confused with Kevin Hooks.&#34;

b&#39;You have to be awfully patient to sit through a film with one-liners so flat and unfunny that you wonder what all the fuss was about when WHISTLING IN THE DARK opened to such an enthusiastic greeting from audiences in the 1940s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On top of some weak one-liners and ordinary sight gags, the plot is as far-fetched as the tales The Fox (Red Skelton) tells his radio audience. You have to wonder why anyone would think he could come up with a real-life solution on how to commit the perfect crime and get away with it. But then, that\&#39;s how unrealistic the comedy is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But--if you\&#39;re a true Red Skelton fan and enjoy a look back at how comedies were made in the \&#39;40s--you can at least enjoy the amiable cast supporting him. Ann Rutherford and Virginia Grey do nicely as his love interest and Conrad Veidt, as always, makes an interesting villain. One of his more amusing moments is his reaction to Skelton explaining the mysteries of wearing turbans. &#34;I never knew that,&#34; he muses, impressed by a minor point that is cleverly introduced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, typical nonsense that requires you to accept the lack of credibility and just accept the gags as they are. Not always easy for a discriminating viewer as many of them simply fall flat, the way many comedies of this era do because the novelty of the sight gags and one-liners has simply worn off.&#39;

b&#39;Has anyone ever read or heard comments by Scorsese or David Chase ( Soprano\&#39;s Exec. Producer) about &#34;Death Collector/Family Enforcer&#34;? I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on cable (like 20 years), but having seen &#34;Goodfellas&#34; and the entire &#34;Sopranos&#34; run to date. In retrospect, both guys must have seen Death Collector/Family Enforcer and absorbed the flavor ,perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks, both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized Godfather trilogy. Being a Jersey guy, it is interesting to see how the Jersey meadowlands have evolved since the mid-70\&#39;s. It is not the swampy dumping ground it used to be although once in a while a body will turn up in a local waterway. Also, it\&#39;s a little bittersweet to seen a newly constructed World Trade Center in the across the river in the opening and closing scene. Who could have imagined?&#39;

b&#39;I cannot believe it has been 25 yrs since I first watched this story on TV. I remembered to have been very much touched by it and was lucky to get the VHS tape several years ago. I did not watch it again until just recently. I have been watched it over and over ever since. I must have watched it 10 times in the past 2 wks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is superb, the story is compelling, and I am embarrassed to say that I did not appreciate actor Bryan Brown\&#39;s talent until now. The playful facial expressions shown in the first half - when he gave Jean the stolen medicine in Malaya is such a contrast to his very reserved and nervous body languages shown in the second half: in their first drink together in Caines and the touring of the homestead. We have to wait until the wedding reception, especially the final dance scene to see his open display of affection for Jean. The same dancing eyes that first revealed his admiration in Malaya. Who wouldn\&#39;t want to be his Mrs. Boong ? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Joe changed from a cocky, almost bigger than life figure in the Malaya jungle to a somewhat self-conscious average Joe in his own backyard, Jean took the opposite road; her wartime experience seems to have given her new confidence. She wasted no time and went after what she wanted. She took steps to take what she could get - exactly as Joe had told her to once upon a time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, all these transformations helps to show this is more than just a love story - this is a story about growth, courage and fragility in life. The solicitor -Noel is both a sweet and sad figure. He too gave much to Jean - he gave his last hope for love. At the end, he did what true love requires -- he put her happiness ahead of his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to like the fight between Joe &amp; Jean that was not in the book. I thought it\&#39;s an appropriate and necessary addition for it helped to surface the inner struggles they both had to deal with in order to make their life together possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I am older, maybe I understand life, love and loss a little better. This story touches me even deeper. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am, however, surprised to see B. Brown has blue eyes in the promo photo shown on this site. He most definitely did not in &#34;A Town like Alice.&#34; Well, 25 yrs is a long time !&#39;

b&#34;I think it&#39;s about 3 years ago when I saw this movie. Accidentally I revisited the info-site for it here and immediately I felt good again!

b&#39;Excellent special effects make this disaster move very plausible. One can see that the producers went to some trouble to get the displays on the computer screens just right - it all makes it very convincing. The sets are also very authentic looking. A good choice of music rounds off the film nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Acting is good and the presence of David Suchet adds some weight to the cast of course. Compared to other movies of this genre, Flood is right up there with the best of them. Thankfully, the &#34;human drama&#34; aspect has not been overdone, as is often the case with this type of movie. The human suffering is portrayed in perfect balance with the actual flooding scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And of course, the movie confirms what many of us suspect anyway: weather forecasters so often do not get it right! :)&#39;

b&#34;this film explores if not creates a whole new genre with perfect imperfection --- hilarity, truth, fun, talent and circumstance that make for MAGIC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from creative musical numbers to off the cuff comedy that incorporates actors at their very best, if i hadn&#39;t have known better, i would have thought there was an elaborate script here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what you get: a mighty wind meets conversations with god meets something so fresh and new and delightful that it becomes it&#39;s own entity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;peters and fell both give stellar performances and reel you in immediately. the rest of the cast is also phenomenal. there are no small parts....... only small actors, and everyone involved here should be patted on the back, taken out to dinner and be considered for an Oscar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;well done!&#34;

b&#39;One Dark Night has a typical teen horror film set-up with a quite a unique twist. The ultra-brooding musical score and Gothic/claustrophobic atmosphere adds greatly to this small film that delivers. Meg Tilly is excellent as &#34;Julie,&#34; and leads us through the maze of the mausoleum, giving a sense of foreboding and loneliness. The other teens are equally effective in their roles as is Melissa Newman, the ultimate heroine of the film. The special effects are excellent, though dated. This film is highly overlooked, but that may be good so that it was never ruined by endless sequels. There is a great, dark magic flowing through this film; once tapped into, you really get it and you\&#39;re in for some fun. The double-disc DVD is available, though the original negative could not be found to restore the film. Maybe someday it will be located. I guess in some ways the carbon speckles in parts do help the film by giving it an old school respectability and making it more unexpected at the end when suddenly there are plenty of effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second disc has a rough cut/alternate version with a temp score version of the film that gives more explanation of the demise of two of the girls, very Poe-ish(&#34;The Cask of Amontillado&#34; comes to mind in a new way!) Also, great ending tension going in on the dark crypt opening. Not sure it had the punch for main stream audiences, but certainly worked for me and extremely creepy.. . also, there is a making of documentary that is interesting because it gives info on what was going on at the time with the actors, crew, director and writer; candid material, then current logos, discussions of shots and scenes, rehearsals. Very unique that this stuff exists for a small film back then.&#39;

b&#39;My mother is as Gone With The Wind as one can be. She has the collector\&#39;s plates, the Rhett and Scarlett Madame Alexander dolls, GWTW Christmas ornaments, even a GWTW cookbook! My sister and I had only seen bits and pieces of GWTW but we knew the whole plot by heart. On a whim, my sister bought this miniseries thinking my mother would like it and we had taken an interest in it after leafing through the novel a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday we decided to watch both Gone With The Wind and Scarlett. We started GWTW at about 2:30 in the afternoon and ended it at 6:30. We started Scarlett right after. My mother usually goes to bed at about 10:00, she wound up staying up until 1:30 with us to finish it! We were riveted! I like how the movie starts off at Melanie\&#39;s funeral, right where Scarlett left off saying, &#34;I\&#39;ll think about it tomorrow.&#34; Scarlett doesn\&#39;t stay in Georgia for long, she runs off to Charleston in her quest to win him back. Rhett is not happy when he finds Scarlett in his home so he leaves for the family\&#39;s plantation. Scarlett, being Scarlett, follows him and they finally agree to put aside their quarrels for a time in order to keep the gossip at bay. Rhett starts to enjoy her company again and takes her out on his boat. A storm comes up and they sink. He helps her swim to the shore of some island. Terrified that she has died, Rhett is anxious until she awakes. When she does they both get swept up in the moment and make love. Scarlett wakes up the next day back in Charleston but Rhett has gone and writes that he thinks it best if they never see each other again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scarlett is heartbroken and when she is so she does some stupid things, in this case she is seen by Anne Hampton going up into a hotel room alone with Ashley. Nothing happens, but her reputation is stained so Scarlett goes to Savannah with her two spinster aunts. She soon discovers that she is pregnant and decides to wait for the right time to tell Rhett. While in Savannah she meets many of her O\&#39;Hara relatives and grows to like one cousin in particular a Father Colum. She soon gets her divorce notice from Rhett and then decides she will never tell him about her baby just to spite him. Typical Scarlett.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She decides to go to Ireland to make sure Rhett can never discover her condition. She meets many more relatives and buys a beautiful ancestral home Ballyhara. Through out this time, Rhett is courting Anne. It is on Halloween when Scarlett gets the notice that Rhett has remarried, she goes into labor that night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie skips to a year later and Scarlett is very happy with her beautiful daughter Kat. She is being pursued by Lord Richard Fenton who is really an evil man, forcing a young girl named Mary Boyle to sleep with him. Scarlett meets Rhett and Anne again at a horse fair. After a riding accident, Scarlett has a conversation with Anne and learns that she and Rhett are to have a baby. Heartbroken again, Scarlett leaves and goes to Dublin with Fenton. There she cultivates a relationship with him, like I said, she does stupid things when she is heartbroken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mary Boyle has discovered she is pregnant and goes to Colum for help. The priest urges Fenton to help the girl and Fenton murders him after Colum threatens to tell Scarlett. Fenton convinces Scarlett to go to London with him to escape her grief over Colum\&#39;s death. Mary asks to go with her. Back in Charleston, Anne has died of Yellow Fever. It is made clear that she never bore Rhett a child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In London, Scarlett sees Fenton\&#39;s true colors after he hurts her when she isn\&#39;t in the mood the sleep with him. Fenton rapes her after she tells him she never wants to see him again. She falls unconscious after and when she wakes up Fenton has been stabbed to death. Scarlett is charged with his murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhett hears about it and rushes off to England with Sally in tow. Fearful of the gallows, Scarlett has no choice but to tell Rhett about their daughter. Rhett is furious at her for keeping such a secret but stays to help her. Mary Boyle, the real killer, can\&#39;t be found. Scarlett is found guilty but Mary finally arrives to declare her innocence. After promising to help Mary, Scarlett leaves with Rhett for Ireland because as he says, &#34;It\&#39;s time I became acquainted with my daughter.&#34; The scene where he sees Kat for the first time is absolutely beautiful. In Ireland, Rhett sees how much Scarlett has changed and the two finally reconcile completely and admit they still love each other deeply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After seeing GWTW, I will say that yes, Vivian Leigh was a better Scarlett, but I liked the character of Scarlett in this film than in the first. The reason being that in GWTW, you don\&#39;t know why you like Scarlett. She\&#39;s so cruel to Rhett and haughty and spoiled, but you like her lively spirit. In Scarlett, you see how much she has changed. Oh she is still in the lap of luxury, but she\&#39;s not haughty anymore. You see how she becomes a true mother to Kat and a generous person to the poor people of Ireland. Joanne Whalley does and excellent job at playing this new side of Scarlett. Timothy Dalton is not Clark Gable, but at times you swear that you can see original Rhett in him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you just sit back and not compare Joanne Whalley and Timothy Dalton with Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, you will most certainly enjoy this movie. It\&#39;s a chance to compare the Scarlett of yesterday, the one she becomes after &#34;tomorrow&#34;.&#39;

b&#39;Thankyou for making such a wonderful escape . That\&#39;s what I love about movies. I\&#39;m so impressed with the aireals , the way they were shot and the timing was so dynamically perfect with the music .being a dancer myself , and having been a part of many dance films choreography is usually chopped ,diced and sometimes not even to the beat.....&#34;Showgirls&#34; the Movie . The relationship between the ladies was ever so present in the movement .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite scene is the last one, when she is pulled over . I\&#39;ve seen the movie before, a different version ., and I disliked the husband more last time . I felt a little more sorry for him this time . It changes how I feel about the female love birds. Its all so magical .&#39;

b&#39;This is one of the funniest movies I\&#39;ve seen in ages. I watched for about 20 minutes, slightly puzzled by what was going on. Then I started to laugh and didn\&#39;t stop \&#39;til long after the movie ended. Such deadpan satire is rare indeed. Christopher Guest has a true eye for the humor inherent in those who have no sense of humor about themselves (about 90% of white heterosexual males, to start with). As in &#34;Waiting for Guffman&#34; Guest nails middle America\&#39;s idiotic self-importance to the wall. I can hardly wait for his next film.&#39;

b&#34;When Pinky, a qualified electrician, is released from prison, his parole officer has found him a job working at a big city bank. When some of the crime underworld from his past learn of his position they plan to exploit it and rob the bank. Pinky is at first horrified because he really wants to go straight, but when a twist of fate happens Pinky begins to think one shouldn&#39;t look a gift horse in the mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also known as The Mayfair Bank Caper {amongst others!}, this is a hugely enjoyable piece that is quintessential 1970s. London and all it&#39;s highly dubious fashions are lit up like a Christmas tree in Ralph Thomas and Guy Elmes&#39; cunningly crafty caper. If the viewer can accept David Niven as an aged crime lord of some evility {it&#39;s not easy i can tell you}, then A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square could well surprise you. The actors aren&#39;t pulling up any trees for sure, but it&#39;s really not hurting the picture at all, it has an honest fun quality that is never less than entertaining. The score and soundtrack is perhaps guilty of over jollification during the dramatic criminal moments, but it&#39;s a minor complaint to leave me thinking this is an under seen British gem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Jordan takes the lead role of Pinky (obviously hoping to lure in American viewers}, 70s heart throb Oliver Tobias {a mass of hair} is in there to keep the ladies interested, whilst the blokes get the pleasurable sight of Elke Sommer and her delightful legs for company. Moving along at a decent enough clip and containing a seriously rewarding finale, A Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square deserves far better than the paltry 5.7 rating here on IMDb, but just how many people have seen it i wonder?, hmm, go on give it a go if you the chance, it&#39;s good stuff. 7/10&#34;

b&#34;This movie will likely be too sentimental for many viewers, especially contemporary audiences. Nevertheless I enjoyed this film thanks mostly to the down-to-earth charm of William Holden, one of my favorite stars, and the dazzling beauty of Jennifer Jones. There are some truly heartwarming scenes between the pair and the talent of these two actors rescues what in lesser hands could&#39;ve been trite lines. The cinematography of Hong Kong from the period of filming is another highlight of this movie. All in all, a better than average romantic drama, 7/10.&#34;

b&#34;The Standard bearer of all movie serials, the definite good guy - Flash Gordon - versus Bad Guy - Ming the Merciless. Though the special effects seem awful by today&#39;s standards, for 1936 they were top notch. But the essence of the story is the battle between Earthman Flash Gordon (Buster Crabbe) versus Emporer Ming of Mongo (Charles Middleton). Crabbe and Middleton are terrific in their parts. And the supporting characters playing Dale Arden, Dr. Zarkov, Princess Aura, Prince Barin, Vulcan, and the rest are all very good. This serial is far superior to the 1980 movie, basically because Crabbe is much much superior to Sam J. Jones as Flash Gordon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This serial is the standard bearer for all movie serials. No question about it.&#34;

b&#39;I believe, that this is a heart tugging film. Richard Donner (Directed the top grossing film &#34;Superman&#34;), had done a great job directing this film. Some of the segemets were good, and several were horrible because, Bobby (Mazzello) was beatened by The King (Baldwin, and especially their dog, Shane attacked the King which meant that he paid for what he had done to Bobby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elijah Wood, portrayed a good role in this film. The memorable scene in this, he dreamt that he took the buffalo\&#39;s advice about Bobby being battered. Lorraine Bracco, (Pre-Soprano)had portrayed an impressing role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this film *** out of four!!!&#39;

b&#39;I saw this mini-series when I was in high school. I remember it as being absolutely brilliant and compelling. At the time, I knew none of the British actors in the series, but have since learned that some of today\&#39;s stars performed in it, including Sean Connery (the original James Bond among many other roles), Judi Dench (Queen Elizabeth in &#34;Shakespeare in Love&#34; among many other roles) and Eilene Atkins (probably best known for creating &#34;Upstairs/Downstairs&#34; but also superb in many acting roles). Like the other commentator, I would like to see it again. I\&#39;m certain the production remains timeless, and I would hope that it has been or will be released on VHS or DVD. If you get a chance to see it, do not miss it.&#39;

b&#39;The three names that mean the most to this film are Burt Reynolds, Mark Wahlberg, and Julianne Moore. These three deliver the strongest performances, but the entire cast does a wonderful job. The film although about the porn industry does not let itself get out of hand with it\&#39;s own sexual premise. On the other hand there were many scenes that involved drug use and although important to understanding the characters lifestyle, I think there was some overkill in this department. Paul Thomas Anderson has not done a great deal of directing, but he may have been picked for this film based on his 1988 work &#34;The Dirk Diggler Story.&#34; One thing that was brilliantly portrayed is the family like atmosphere between the characters as they work, live, and party together. Although not a typical family they certainly seem to care for each other. The wonderful soundtrack really helps give you a feel for the period during a time when disco was the rage. There are many disco favorites on it and some other wonderful songs as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a gifted young man named Eddie Adams (Wahlberg) that gets invited into the porn industry. He changes his name to Dirk Diggler and becomes and adult film star almost overnight. Jack Horner (Reynolds) is the director that takes his films very seriously as he believes his work is more than just pornography, but that they are true art. However Dirk becomes overly dependent on drugs and soon heads down a dangerous road where he stands to loose everything. Although a greater focus is placed on the character Dirk there are subplots for the other characters and their trials in life. You will find yourself wishing for and hoping their situations improve. All-in-all a well done film.&#39;

b&#39;Just watched this film on TV and it was awesome. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;had just planned on watching it whilst doing some work however i ended up watching the whole film with out doing work as it was so good! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actors my not be very well know but the story line makes up for it. the fact that the actors make are less well known only makes it more believable that the events could occur. i did not feel a biased towards one character as i have no judgement of the types of character as i have never seen any of the actors in a film before which made it even more enjoyable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would recommend watching it.&#39;

b&#34;This short has all the elements of a great movie. Every time I show it to friends (on DVR) they love it too. The dialog is so, &#39;real&#39;. The acting is superb. While the effects/props weren&#39;t as convincing by themselves, taken with everything else in the shot, they are expertly placed/used. The music is so haunting, perfect for this kind of &#39;moment&#39; film. People who hold dear their beliefs and thoughts are shaken to their core about what they see in this movie. Most go &#39;that&#39;s it?&#39;, but in the end they blossom with new understanding, and leave the movie with one word to describe it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Beautiful&#39;. The beauty of the film is also skin deep. I love the fact that there aren&#39;t any conflicting views, no other voices, and the voices that you do hear, are agreeing with each other. no conflict, but at the same time there is one. And the ending made me love it more! Harsh reality sometimes IS more film worthy than any plot device, or twist. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(wasn&#39;t Joshua Leonard the guy in Blair Witch Project?) :) Movie by a fictitious dead guy..great!&#34;

b&#34;This film, winning Im Kwon-Taek the Best Director at Cannes in 2002 (tied with P.T. Anderson for Punch-Drunk Love), is about a 19th century Korean painter with a commoner&#39;s roots and significant impact on Korean painting. One of the strengths?of the film is that Im tries to help us see with the eye of a painter, so we see multiple scenes and objects which help our drunken painter friend, Jang Seung-up (Choi Min-shik),?receive inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The costumes and the art direction are all impressive and the acting is even along being good. It&#39;s not a movie that moved me, but it was one that made me think about art and what it means to find your own voice in it. That&#39;s pretty cool. It&#39;s also interesting to see a version of Korea during those times right before the turn of the century, where Chinese and Japanese powers are both in Korea and the Chosun kingdom is coming to an end. More than one revolution and political ideology are gathered in the film, but are never the center. It&#39;s firmly on the painter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, it&#39;s a well made film about the life of a painter. But it doesn&#39;t exactly have the regular three-act structure plot, so you have to be able to take a non-standard Hollywood story to watch it. Yay for art! 8/10&#34;

b&#39;Once again, there\&#39;s dastardly government agencies stopping at nothing to prevent public knowledge of some momentous events. In this case, the discovery of a new underwater species that could threaten the planet\&#39;s ecology. Although the creature is no E.T. he does seem to befriend one youngster, who protects it at all costs, not realising it is but an infant of the species and is going to get a lot bigger \xc2\x96 and badder This 2005 series had a lot going for it. It is family drama, sci-fi, thriller with more than a few comedic moments. The characters are believable, well acted and well photographed. The show holds the attention. Of course, as with any sci-fi show, suspension of disbelief has to be achieved. And I think it is here. Alas, the series crashed after season one, so we never get a resolution. Infuriating.. There is a general comment I feel worth making here. Many TV networks and/or film distribution companies cancel, quite arbitrarily, seemingly excellent TV series \xc2\x96 particularly intelligent sci-fi ones. Now there may be some very good reasons for this, although the audiences are treated with utmost disdain and rarely told the reasons. This in itself is annoying. What really gets my goat is that, having cancelled the series, they then issue the thing as far as it\&#39;s got, on DVD, in an obvious attempt to milk the cash cow as far as possible. For previous viewers of the series that\&#39;s OK, they know what they\&#39;re in for but \xc2\x85 many of these unfinished series end on a cliffhanger. Two that come to mind immediately are &#34;Surface&#34;, and &#34;Odyssey 5&#34;. If you\&#39;ve heard good things about the series and not seen it you go and buy the blasted DVD and end up with an unresolved plot issue \xc2\x96 it makes me very angry!! I enjoyed &#34;Surface&#34; immensely and didn\&#39;t realise the poor characters would end up in a situation that looked totally untenable \xc2\x96 and we\&#39;ll never know what happened next. I believe that there should be a prominent notice on all such DVD issues, to the effect that the story is unfinished. Nowadays I check on TV series purchases (IMDB is an obvious excellent starting point) to find out whether a \&#39;complete\&#39; series is really complete or not. Buyer beware.&#39;

b&#34;My favorite film this year. Great characters and plot, and the direction and editing was smooth, visually beautiful, and interesting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Set in Barcelona, the film follows a year in the lives of six foreign graduate students and assorted others. Cultures and languages clash but hearts and lives intertwine. The leading role would never have been cast in Hollywood, but he carried the part perfectly. The characters were nicely developed and their interplay was honest and accurate. There were two especially noteworthy scenes, the climax was truly inspired. The film is sentimental, and the last ten minutes could have been cut, but it was wonderfully entertaining. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I nearly didn&#39;t watch it, but did just to see Audrey Tautou. Her role although billed second or third was minor, and was outshined by several other characters. I wish more films like this were made. It brought to mind The Big Chill or The Breakfast Club. Don&#39;t start this movie late if you plan to go to bed 1/2 way through.&#34;

b&#39;i consider this movie as one of the most interesting and funny movies of all time. It has so much highly intelligent thoughts in it, that anybody who thinks the movie is awful did not get it and is not able to recognize really deep philosophical themes, which are in it (in all the 3 Schneider movies) without a doubt. Several universities in germany and throughout europe have made studies on Schneider\&#39;s way of seeing things. By the way, Helge Schneider is a very intelligent and sensitive person and on of the Jazz-musicions in germany (maybe europe). He is mostly inspired by the great M.Davis and T.Monk. So if you do not like him, it is ok, but please do not try to convince others that he might be stupid, cheap, boring or not funny. Because if you had to face this opinion in a discussion and if you are willing to really look into the art of H.Schneider you would have to &#34;surrender&#34;.&#39;

b&#39;I really enjoyed this movie. I have probably watched it 2 dozen times or more and still enjoy it. Being an old Navy guy, Im still stirred by the rousing rendition of Anchors Away! I also love the &#34;McHales Navy&#34; pirate atmosphere. I could have done without the female dive officer but Im just old fashioned I guess. She was still good to look at, lol, espesially after the crew got done with her laundry. The cook, sonarman, and electrician made the movie. Loved the salty old engineer and his first class PO too. And Grammer actually did a very commendable job of being a misfit Officer. I loved the &#34;driving scene&#34; as they passed the golf course on the way into port, lol. Pure Navy! And I swear I had an XO that was just like that little weasel... Im am so glad this is out on DVD, about bloody time. :0)&#39;

b&#39;Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films (although it doesn\&#39;t fit into that genre itself) - the rise and the fall. We see the rise of several individuals, some of them from complete obscurity, to achieving great heights ... and then falling from grace due to their excesses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this is the first feature by writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson, and it\&#39;s a great start! I saw elements of other directors\&#39; influences, such as Robert Altman, but the film holds its own in originality and plot development.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Character development is the movie\&#39;s finest feature. I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them. All of the performances were brilliant. (It was especially good to see a small part performed by real-life porn veteran, Nina Hartley).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this film combines comedy and tragedy with the result being one of the best films of 1997, which was snubbed at the Oscars (probably due to the &#34;racy&#34; - as they would say - subject matter, and the general conservatism of the Academy.&#39;

b&#34;TV newscaster Kimberly Wells (Jane Fonda) and her radical camerman Richard Adams (Michael Douglas) are at a nuclear power plant when a serious accident happens. The plants managers play it down but Adams has filmed it all. Wells and Adams try to get it on the air but the corporation that runs the plant prevents it. Plant executive Jack Godell (Jack Lemmon) realizes there are serious problems and tests have been falsified. He tries to get executives to believe him--only they know it. Wells, Adams and Godell find all their lives are in danger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw this in a movie theatre in 1979. I was only 17 and it scared me silly. To make matters worse the Three Mile Island accident happened around this time making the movie all that more real. Seeing it over 20 years later it doesn&#39;t scare me but it still is an excellent film--it works as a mystery, a gripping drama and an expose on the nuclear power industry. Fonda (with red hair) has one of her best roles as Wells--she perfectly conveys her character&#39;s growing suspicion and horror when she realizes a nuclear disaster could happen. Lemmon is (as always) excellent. He starts out believing in his company and the job and slowly starts to unravel when he starts finding things out. He was rightfully nominated for an Academy Award for this. Douglas is good but he has a small part and is completely overshadowed by Lemmon and Fonda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A really great film--one of the best of the 70s. Don&#39;t miss this one!&#34;

b&#34;A competent comedy that delivers the laughs for fans of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau. I suppose this film was made for those who enjoyed the two GRUMPY OLD MEN films, as there seemed to be a bunch of these buddy team-ups spotlighting the comical duo in their twilight years. The idea is a sure-fire one: Matthau, a bumbling gambler who&#39;s thousands of dollars in debt, connives his unsuspecting friend Lemmon into taking a free cruise with him where they can meet rich old ladies; the catch is, they&#39;ve been signed on as Dance Hosts and Matthau can&#39;t dance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OUT TO SEA is a funny film, and not all of the chuckles are to be found courtesy of Lemmon and Matthau. I found Brent Spiner (best known as Data from STAR TREK: THE NEXT GENERATION) to be very humorous as the snobby ball-busting dance coordinator. As the prissy boss of the two aging actors, he manages to match them in the laughs department. Though the film doesn&#39;t really need any, there&#39;s also a a love story or two to be found here as well, involving Dyan Cannon (who looks pretty fine for her years).&#34;

b&#39;Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson respectively, the second of the Universal series, where it\&#39;s again established by means of a written prologue that the famed detective is legendary and spans time. This helps to comfortably set things up here in the &#34;present&#34; era of the early 1940\&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this offering, Holmes goes through a few different disguises (with Rathbone\&#39;s very prominent features, is it likely that people really wouldn\&#39;t recognize his true identity?) as he protects a physicist from the hands of the Nazis as well as from Holmes\&#39; greatest nemesis Professor Moriarty (now played by Lionel Atwill). The scientist has developed a bomb sight which will greatly aid in aerial bombardment, and he\&#39;s promised his plans to the British. But Moriarty wants to get hold of it so he can sell them to the Nazis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A good entry boosted a bit by the participation of the properly villainous Atwill now cast as Moriarty (though George Zucco was no slouch himself in THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES). It\&#39;s always intriguing watching Holmes and his greatest enemy engaging in witty banter together (&#34;the needle to the last, eh, Holmes?&#34;).&#39;

b&#39;From 1950 comes a neat thriller about a couple smuggling diamonds from abroad and also the contagious disease smallpox. Evelyn Keyes pulls out all stops as the essential victim of this film-noir. Once back in the United States she is not aware that she could be spreading the disease on everyone and everything she comes in contact with. Eventually she is pursued and must be stopped before an epidemic occurs. Other than Keyes striking performance there is good support from villainous Charles Korvin, William Bishop, Dorothy Malone, Lola Albright and Whit Bissell. The finale is a humdinger with Miss Keyes on the ledge of a building with spotlights and hundreds of spectators below. A good B flick!&#39;

b&#34;What a wonderful film, filled with eccentric, unique characters who are wonderfully realized by a great ensemble cast. The director also did a great job keeping the story held together, getting those wonderful performances (on not messing with them) and using music (and what wonderful music it is) to great effect. S. Epatha in the lead role is great. I had always heard what a brilliant stage actor she is, and although I have enjoyed her on Law and Order, this really shows what she can do with a filled out, complex role. Macy Gray is terrific, Mos Def, as usual, wonderful. Lou Gossett, great. Jimmy Smits, terrific, and doesn&#39;t try to pull focus because he&#39;s a star. A true piece of ensemble acting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rent it, enjoy it, groove to it, and treasure it. Something special.&#34;

b&#34;Opera (the U.S. title is terror at the opera) is somewhat of a letdown after some of Dario&#39;s other movies like Phenomena, Tenebre, and Suspiria. (i still can&#39;t find Inferno anywhere.) it&#39;s one of those movies that has a great first half but midway through it&#39;s like someone started slowly letting the air out of the screenplay and logic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the basic plot involves a beautiful opera singer who is being stalked by a deranged obsessed fan. this killer begins killing people close to her in a most unique fashion. he binds and gags her and tape tiny sharp pins under her eyelids so if she tries to close her eyes she&#39;ll gouge out her eyes. this forces her to watch while the killer murders her acquaintances in typically brutal and gory Argento fashion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;unfortunately, about midway through the film becomes sluggish and illogical. (this is especially directed towards the killer&#39;s motivations. i still haven&#39;t completely figured out why he&#39;s such a nut.) the ending especially come out of left field in the worst possible sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but, for about the first hour or so this is some of Dario&#39;s best filmmaking and the camera work is breathtaking. too bad it couldn&#39;t maintain it through to the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rating:7&#34;

b&#34;A dark and painful look at the perils of drug addiction, Sinatra is wonderful in this film. Just watching his frenzied writhing and screaming and destructive rage near the end of the film is enough to make anyone think twice about trying heroin; maybe they should show this to kids in health class instead of the mindless drivel we are compelled to endure year after year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s the story of a man who is simply trying to make a new, clean life for himself after being in prison, trying to rid himself of his drug habit and his job of dealing cards in illegal gambling operations, who is pulled down, pulled back into the muck by the evils of human nature. He is being taken advantage of by his employers, the drug dealers, and even his enigmatic, crafty-yet-stupid wife. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you didn&#39;t like the film itself, it&#39;s worth seeing just for the soundtrack. It&#39;s all heavy, swinging jazz with large drum and brass sections. This, with its groovy, yet slightly sinister sound, helps set the mood, along with the grinning, snaky drug and card dealers, who always seem to hover like vultures around Frankie Machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to anyone -- especially if you like film noir, zoot suits, fedoras, or jazz.&#34;

b&#34;Project A II is a classic Jackie Chan movie with all the kung fu, crazy stunts and slapstick humor you expect. Not as good as the prequel but still it is a great movie if you just want something fun to watch. The story is simple, jackie chan versus the evil men. So if you want a movie that you don&#39;t have to be a braniac to understand, i would suggest this one.&#34;

b&#34;On first viewing this movie seems to be some kind of fairy tale about a beautiful and significantly white horse once seen never forgotten. However viewed strictly within the context of the story the implication is that to survive in the immediate post-Civil War America, one had to have a horse, and not any old horse but a truly great one. And Eagle&#39;s Wing is such a horse. But for a man to be worthy of such a horse is another matter. Who should own it? The Native American or the AWOL soldier? The story throughout pits primitivism against civilisation. As has been said by other commentators it is ironic that it took an English director to perceive this fact, and then develop this simple theme into a western like no other you&#39;re ever likely to see again. The film is basically about this beast and the savage harshness of the environment and the people who scrape a living from it. The photography and the soundtrack are exquisite. Martin Sheen&#39;s performance is a revelation. This film, released in the same year as Sheen&#39;s other great performance as Willard in &#39;Apocalypse Now&#39;, hints at his abilities which somehow were never given such a free rein again. More&#39;s the pity. A comparison of the two stories throws up the surprising similarities between them - not least that both films chart a man&#39;s journey into his soul in order to find redemption. Whereas Willard is redeemed I will leave it to the viewer to decide if Pike is eventually. The ending is fabulous in the true sense of the word, and very moving; be warned. Altogether this is an extraordinary film.&#34;

b&#34;Now maybe it had something to do with the fact that I saw this movie at a low point in my life, when I was really trying to figure out where I was going and what I needed to make myself happy, but this film really spoke to me. Jane is an everywoman: although she has so many positive things going for her, she is still vulnerable and unhappy in her life. She is strong and intelligent, but she was cheated out of achieving her potential by an unfortunate accident and is living a second-choice life. She seeks out new challenges and happiness, seeking desperately to fill the hole in her heart. Dreya Weber is an exquisite Jane. As we journey with her we feel the depth of her despair, the torture of her desperation and, eventually, the strength of her conviction. The beautiful Addie Yungmee is also very well cast and an asset to the production. Allison Mackie is a scene stealer as a saucy character with impeccable timing. I highly recommend this film; although it&#39;s low budget, it has big budget writing and production values. PS- great aerial scenes with two beautiful sexy women. Women will love the story and characters, but there&#39;s something for the men here, too. :)&#34;

b&#39;Sometimes, you\&#39;re up late at night flipping through the stations, bored out of your mind, and wanting some light and fluffy romantic comedy that doesn\&#39;t make you feel bipolar. And this movie fit that exact billing. Sure, the plot was ripped right out of the 1930s....the writing as schmaltzy as the Hallmark Greeting Card company\&#39;s legendary poetry, and the one- dimensional characters were played by a cast plucked straight from Central Casting - but it was CUTE, and exactly what I needed last night. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lauren Holly and Costas Mandylor have great chemistry together - I liked it on &#34;Picket Fences,&#34; and I\&#39;m happy to say they still have it over 10 year later. Costas Mandylor, at 41, is still possibly one of the handsomest men to grace the screens since ol\&#39; Rudy Valentino kicked the bucket 80 years ago. RRROWRR! Bonus points for casting that funny man who used to be on the roller skates on that show about the cartoon lady. I always thought he was something straight out of a Hepburn-Grant comedy. BRAVO!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people will probably say this was the corniest piece of cinema ever made, and I would probably have to agree - but come on! It\&#39;s on the Hallmark Channel. What were you expecting? Just sit back, relax, eat some sesame sticks, and watch a sweet little movie with two cute people and down a bottle of Zinfandel. Trust me, you\&#39;ll love and accept the schmaltz a whole lot more, and then you can go to sleep dreaming about Costas Mandylor swimming in a sea of tempered chocolate feeding you petit fours with minty fresh chocolate icing. YUMMO! (PS. Now I have a hankering for petit fours. THANKS A LOT, HALLMARK!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wish the evil girl had been cast with Rachel Ray, and maybe that dishy food nerd Alton Brown as the announcer instead of the creepy dude with the Van Dyk beard. Shudder! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That would have made my night. But hey, check out &#34;Just Desserts.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;A very interesting documentary - certainly a lot more than Sideways, a pseudo wino drama - where the capitalist conspiracy is revealed in all its greed. According to the documentary - and confirmed by the recent publication of a biography on Parker - only two men dictate the nature of wines in the world: Robert Parker of Massachussets and Michel Rolland, a French wine industry expert based in Bordeaux and also known as a &#34;flying winemaker&#34;. The director is clever enough to insert interviews of local wine producers from many different regions of France, from Sicily to Argentina and interviews of the biggest players in the industry such as the Mondavi family to uncover the wraps on the globalization of wine making and marketing. A must see for anyone interested in the dark side of the industry. Drinking a glass of wine will not be the same political and commercial act after watching this well made documentray.&#39;

b&#39;Everyone told me to see &#34;Cactus Flower,&#34; and I finally did. What a wonderful movie -- the perfect pick-me-up for a Sunday night/dreading Monday morning. Matthau and Hawn were good, but Ingrid Bergman really made this movie -- after all, it was really about her. The truly great actors can do anything, and Miss Bergman proves it. She shows us -- in the course of one film -- a range few people display in their entire career. The scene in the dance club was as hysterical as it was touching. Even as the film drew to its obvious conclusion, I found myself cheering for Miss Dickinson as if she were the Boston Red Sox. Thankfully, she made out (no pun intended) much better. ;)&#39;

b&#34;This movie is just brilliant, SRK&#39;s acting is just amazing, the end is so incredibly sad, I cry every time I see this film, it&#39;s the kind you never get sick of, and can see again and again, an absolutely amazingly brilliant movie.&#34;

b&#39;Another &#34;end of the world&#34; film that begs comparison to the abysmal &#34;Day After Tomorrow&#34;. Following the same sort of structure as DAT but with a distinctly Japanese style. How does it fare? That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of it\&#39;s 2 + hours. Also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science. The effects are probably the best I\&#39;ve seen in a Japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of Hollywood. Many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen. And that is one of the drawbacks. While the terror of thousands of on- screen deaths like in the recent &#34;War of the Worlds might have too overwhelming, we also don\&#39;t really get a sense of the chaos of an entire nation crumbling into the ocean. A few scenes touch on the chaos but for the most part this part of the story is barely touched on. Regardless, this film works on a lot of levels and is way more realistic then DAT, that is until the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the story hinges itself on one clich\xc3\xa9d plot device and another plot device that would be at home in the 1960\&#39;s Japanese Earth in peril film &#34;Gorath&#34;. After the reasonably good science and mostly realistic take on the disaster, this makes for a bit of disappointment. The sudden stopping of the film for a pop love song doesn\&#39;t help either (unless you like the song). This made the &#34;exciting&#34; ending a bit of a drag for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The overall direction is good and the art design is excellent. Acting is all good as well. Recommended.&#39;

b&#39;Mickey Mouse is now 75 years old. He was created by Walt Disney, a famous creater, producer, director etc: I love the Disney Movies because it is great fun watching the cartoon movies. Altogether Walt Disney i think is the king of the creations, Everyone has got to love this creations and the movies by Walt Disney. Thank you Walt for all the classic characters you made.&#39;

b&#39;This film is well cast, often silly and always funny. Lemmon and Matthau work their tag team magic to perfection. Brent Spiner is just a riot as the egotistical tyrant of a cruise director. From the first &#34;hare krishna&#34; to the last &#34;you ought pay him fifty bucks for calling you two studs&#34;, I thought this was a totally entertaining fun comedy&#39;

b&#34;This is a wonderful film taking place during the romantic period of the Civil War. This film is a must see for Eastwood Fans and Eastwood claims this is one of his most favorite films that he did. I couldn&#39;t agree more. Watch out! This is a spoiler- Eastwood does die in the end. Eastwood and director Don Siegel rightfully argued that the ending should be unexpected and should be unhappy for a few reasons. They wanted to stick to the book, for one. Secondly, there can&#39;t always be a happy ending. Thirdly, this was written during the Vietnam War- they wanted a negative statement to this terrible struggle of war where people were needlessly dying. I agree with all of this. It is a wonderfully shot film and I love most films involving the Civil War. It is more of a portrait of how deceptive women can be- that they can be more dangerous than men, hence the title has much to do with the statement of the film BEGUILED- to be deceived. The song sung by Eastwood at the beginning and the end of the film is another statement against not just the Civil War but the Vietnam War and maybe indirectly the women he comes across during the film. Wonderful story of love and deception and many memorable scenes- NOTE: This film is rated R for no reason. There is hardly any language, it is probably some of the subject matter involving sex- but there is no nudity really. Excellent film- 9/10.&#34;

b&#39;Marco Poloni (Costas Mandylor) was born into a baking family in the Bronx. Although the Polonis have been well known for their confections over the decades, the business has fallen on hard times. Meanwhile, Grace Carpenter (Lauren Holly) is a most talented dessert maker in Manhattan but, she can not seem to land a prime confectionery position because of the glass ceiling. An accidental meeting between Marco and Grace results in a conversation about a possible solution for them both. There is a high profile bake-off, The Golden Whisk, taking place in the near future and Marco wants Grace to partner with him. There is a hefty amount of &#34;dough&#34;, haha, at stake for the winners, enough to set Grace up in her own business and save the Polonis eatery, too. Reluctantly, Grace agrees. But, there are complications. Some of the judges and fellow contestants may have past issues with both Grace and Marco. Then, too, although Marco and Grace both feel some sort of attraction for the other, Grace has a long standing, very rich boyfriend. Can Marco and Grace win the contest? This is a lovely film for the romantic at heart. First, there is the nice cast. Holly has always been a lovely actress with a notable husky voice that furthers her attractions. In this film, she is perfectly cast as the determined but beautiful Grace. Mandylor, a newcomer, delights, too as the good-looking rival baker. The rest of the actors, including the wonderful Brenda Vaccaro as Marco\&#39;s mother, is quite nice. As a Hallmark movie, the costumes, sets, and production amenities are beyond reproach and the script still manages to seem fresh and funny, despite some familiar themes. Treat yourself, romcom lovers, to a most sweet confection by securing a viewing of this film. It is definitely the movie equivalent of a big box of quality chocolates.&#39;

b&#39;&#34;Family Guy&#34; is probably the most ballsy sitcom ever produced. It relentlessly skewers everything it can think of, from TV shows to family drama. Best of all, it\&#39;s one of the few TV shows on today that\&#39;s actually funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The show revolves around the Griffins: Peter, the obese father whose schemes are limited by his lack of intelligence. Lois, the mother who is more or less the head of the family, even though Peter considers himself to be that. Chris, the fat teenage son who has just as few brains as his dad. Meg, the black sheep of the family that is the but of everyone\&#39;s jokes. Stewie, the baby who has plans for killing his mother and taking over the world. And Brian, the family dog, who is frequently the voice of reason, but is frequently corrupted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Family Guy&#34; employs many tactics to get laughs from the audience. Most notable are the frequent cutaways that spoof what has just been said. They are effective because of the impeccable timing, and in how they play out. &#34;Family Guy&#34; uses spoofs to get humor as well, most commonly from 80\&#39;s TV shows. What really makes the show so great is that a person doesn\&#39;t have to be familiar with what it\&#39;s spoofing. I\&#39;m sure it would help, but the material is funny enough in its own right. But the show doesn\&#39;t stop there. Not only does it spoof just about everything, it skewers its own spoofs! The show is filled with off-color humor. The only reason why people aren\&#39;t up in arms about the show is probably because it makes fun of every race, sex and other generality equally. There is nothing sacred here, and no one and nothing is immune from &#34;Family Guy\&#39;s&#34; satirical jabs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Putting on musical numbers in a film takes a lot of time and effort, and it\&#39;s a very big risk. But &#34;Family Guy&#34; contains some great songs. All well-written and performed, and of course they are hilarious (perhaps the most famous one, &#34;The Freakin\&#39; FCC&#34; is both catchy, and hysterical because it hits the ratings board where it hurts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The voice characterizations are right on the money. Seth McFarlane is tremendously talented. He provides the voices for Peter, Brian (which is his own natural voice), and Stewie. Not only are the voices consistent and creative, he can alter their pitch at will, so it really seems as if they are spoken by three different actors. Alex Borstein brings a nasally drawl to Lois that is perfect for the character. Seth Green is unrecognizable as Chris (had I not looked on IMDb, I would have never known that it was him). Lacey Chabert originated the character of Meg, and while she was good, Mila Kunis really elevated the character with her sharp voice. Kunis gives Meg a new, sharper edge that she didn\&#39;t have with Chabert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;Family Guy&#34; has been compared to &#34;The Simpsons,&#34; and that\&#39;s entirely understandable (and not just because they are produced by FOX). Both are satires of blue-collar life, and while &#34;The Simpsons&#34; is good, &#34;Family Guy&#34; contains are sharper edge. The show is utterly fearless. There is no real sacred cow. The show lampoons handicaps (physical and mental), ethnicities, TV shows and movies, celebrities, politicians, religion (especially catholicism), drug use and addiction, sexual humor of all kinds (including S&amp;M), and some that\&#39;s just beyond description. Not everything &#34;Family Guy&#34; throws at the audience works, but as a whole, the show is consistently amusing and frequently hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there\&#39;s any flaw with &#34;Family Guy,&#34; it\&#39;s that the jokes run on far too long sometimes. Particularly with the &#34;awkward moment&#34; jokes, the sequences are stretched for so long that not only does it cease to become funny, it becomes so irritating (and long) that a fast-forward button is warranted. These can be effective at about 10 to 15 seconds, but the show sometimes stretches these to beyond two minutes. One could argue that the show rewrites its rules to suit the plot, and it often does (for example, Brian frequently acts like a person, but he still acts like a dog when the story requires it). But that\&#39;s not a problem because the show still works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have argued that the show has stopped being funny. While I agree that it\&#39;s not as edgy as it used to be, I think the blame lies with FOX, not McFarlane and his crew. The show originated with FOX, but after some lackluster ratings and viewer turnout, it was canceled. However, DVD sales were large enough for it to be picked up by Adult Swim. The show became an instant success, and it was once again bought by FOX. However, because the show is so big now, FOX is afraid to let the writers experiment and try new things. While it\&#39;s still funny, the humor is not as fresh and edgy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely check this show out. It\&#39;s awesome.&#39;

b&#39;I laughed my ass off for an hour. I had no idea who Dan Finneity was. Why haven\&#39;t I heard of Dan Finnerty before? He\&#39;s hysterical and so are his backup singers. They make all of these women songs that we would never wanna hear a new experience. They blow these songs away. This was on Bravo last night. Why isn\&#39;t this Dan guy like &#34;ultra famous&#34;? Great voice! Charisma to burn! He blew me away with this show! I just read on the internet that he was once a member of &#34;Stomp&#34; I guess there isn\&#39;t anything he can\&#39;t do. I saw &#34;Stomp&#34; at a UCLA theater years ago and those guys were amazing. This show last night was done by Dreamworks! Does that mean that Spielberg did this? Why don\&#39;t they star this Dan Finnerty in a movie. There was a standing ovation at the end of this show and every time the camera\&#39;s cut to the audience, everyone was so into it, singing along or dancing. The whole show had this amazing energy. My only complaint was that it was not longer, but looking back, when you see how much energy these guys put out, I guess it would be impossible for any human being to perform with such gusto for over an hour. Man I loved this show!&#39;

b&#34;This is one of the bleakest, the most harrowing of Bergman&#39;s films I&#39;ve seen. I also think this is one of the most powerful films about the ugliness of war and what it does to the human souls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The couple of musicians, who left a big city for a remote island and make a living as farmers, find themselves capable of unspeakable and shameful acts that would have ordinarily been impossible for them even imagine, as they struggle to survive horrible reality of war. They betray their souls, their friends and even each other in a desperate attempt to simply survive another day. Liv Ullmann and Max Von Sydow are brilliant as usual as lost, confused, and terrified couple that got caught in the midst of a civil war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;9.5/10&#34;

b&#34;This movie brilliantly captures the atmosphere of a D&amp;D group. While watching, I could not help but notice how vividly characters reminded me of myself and my gaming friends to the point where they acted literally the same as we do. Including the bickering, the fighting, the internal jokes, driving the DM crazy. EVERYTHING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has it all. Jokes that made me cry, action scenes which, even filmed in low-budget, I found uncannily awesome. The story is pretty straightforward and unsurprising, but that doesn&#39;t really matter, since the best part of the movie is to see the characters react and interact with each other and the NPCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if you&#39;re playing D&amp;D or any similar RPG, I cannot stress this enough, WATCH THIS MOVIE, it captured beautifully the spirit of D&amp;D.&#34;

b&#34;This existential thriller, in Portuguese with English subtitles, is a modern version of the American filmes noires of the 40s, complete with a surprise twist at the end. It is riveting from beginning to end. My only criticism is its poor production values. The film looks cheaply made, and it probably was, so the black and white cinematography is vastly inferior to that of Godard in Vivre Sa Vie, to cite another film noir of more than 30 years earlier. Most maddening of all, the subtitles are often hard to read. When will filmmakers learn and provide yellow subtitles so that they can be read against a white background. I&#39;d give this an 8 overall, although with better production values it could have been higher.&#34;

b&#34;I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script. Susan Sarandon plays the part of a flighty, irrational and possessive mother, who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together. She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Indiana to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood. The daughter is dubious, but at first she has no choice--- the bond with mother is pathologically strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground. She sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome, seductive guy who loves &#39;em and leaves &#39;em. She sees that the mother doesn&#39;t get it. So how can she look to her mother for guidance?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mother directs the girl to a drama try-out and sees the daughter act out the part of the mother in such a way that a shockingly painful mirror is held up to the fly-by-night mother. This causes a period of depression and the girl is horrified at the impact on the mother and is apologetic, but the lesson takes hold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is character-growth as the mother realizes her selfish claim on the daughter and eventually is persuaded to let the girl go. It is a touching scene and a valuable lesson, that parents, however emotionally dependent, have to let the child go and become her own separate person.&#34;

b&#39;Cardiff, Wales. A bunch of 5 mates are deeply bored in this town. There\&#39;s Jip who works in a clothes shop. Coop, an easy-going DJ. Nina, inseparable from her best friend Lulu and Moff. The week is hell for them and they only wait for one thing: the week-end. At this time, they got out to a nightclub and to the sound of tech no music, they experience different drugs, particularly ecstasy. Then, they usually continue the party to a friend\&#39;s. At the end of this really good time on Sunday, the feelings are the following ones: tiredness, melancholy, just the memory of a crazy night...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surfing on the wave of the notorious success of &#34;Trainspotting&#34; (1996), this debut movie written and directed by Justin Kerrigan brings and develops a new variation about the notion of hedonism. It means: how to have fun as much as possible while knowing that you have a shortened lapse of time. Indeed, as I have previously written, for the 5 main characters of the movie, the week is hell and the weekend is the only time they can free themselves and have a wild time without the single pressure (besides, Jip in one sequence talks about the positive aspects of shooting oneself: you are numb, you don\&#39;t feel any pressure, you are like an astronaut in orbit above the earth. Kerrigan\&#39;s relentless directorial style expresses very well the spirit of debauchery and care freeness of the 5 protagonists. They only live to take advantage as much as possible of an hedonist week-end. Furthermore, to spice up a little more the festive atmosphere in which his movie bathes, Kerrigan isn\&#39;t afraid to include dreamlike sequences which represent his characters\&#39; fantasy or embarrassments. Then, &#34;Human Traffic&#34; (1999) is also served by a particularly bouncy sound track. The amount? A perfect symbiosis between the sound and the music. At last, this week-end of euphoria enables to shelve momentarily the usual drab image of the popular social classes, British cinema has studied a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Notwithstanding, when a movie (conscientiously or not) exploits the fame of another famous one, it rarely matches the brilliance of its predecessor. &#34;Human Traffic&#34; is in this condition. There\&#39;s little inventiveness at the level of the narrative structure and the introduction of the characters and one can note down a few useless digressions (Jip who, in the nightclub goes in the manager\&#39;s office and tells him a cock-and-bull story so as to enable Moff to enter the club but that\&#39;s no use because the latter succeeds in coming without problems). One can also blame Kerrigan to overlook the dramatic sides that the story could have involved. His movie can also be read as a transition from euphoria to paranoia and the dramatic connotations of this second pole aren\&#39;t virtually explored. It\&#39;s a shame! It could have conveyed the following message: even in the happiest moments, there can be something terrible preparing which can flop them. The same remark could also be said when Coop has a fit of jealousy because Nina broaches a guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It may not be the last great film of the nineties as it is billed on the DVD cover but &#34;Human Traffic&#34; is to be taken as a good and incisive little movie which conveys with the styles and the fashions of the end of the twentieth century, a will to have fun without ulterior motives and trouble. An ideal movie to start any party or before going to a club.&#39;

b&#34;When i was told about this movie i wasn&#39;t too happy to see it, although by the end credits, turned out to be one of THE best movies i have ever viewed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the movie it self is quite graphic (male to male scenes, you don&#39;t see everything) wouldn&#39;t be a gay themed movie if there wasn&#39;t...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the movie is very light hearted with humor and contains some very funny parts. i highly recommend this movie, about 3 quarters through you really feel for the main characters, and this i think brings the whole flick together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once again, very nicely put together.. plus cute Mormon.&#34;

b&#34;i see there are great reviews of this film already, i&#39;ve got a few points to comment on, reasons i thought there was something special about this film...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;first and foremost, the film is realistic. it may not seem realistic to an adult who has forgotten what it was like being a teenager, but that&#39;s really the kind of superdrama that goes on amongst teens all the time. second, the good guy, the guy who treats women with respect, doesn&#39;t get the girls. that&#39;s the way it is, in real life just the same! he&#39;s too nice for his own good. people are just selfish. third, it was nice to see a fat guy who had some self-confidence. i mean, that role already takes confidence from the actor, i&#39;m not just talking about the character. overall i thought the film was a positive surprise that secretly hides amongst wacky, partyin&#39; teen sex comedies at the rental shelf. don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s not all sad, it&#39;s a good laugh as well.&#34;

b&#34;Surprisingly Kieslowski&#39;s this movie is disappointing to me because of the sometimes weird and sometimes clich\xc3\xa9 script that also seems a work of a poor observation sometimes. There is an isolated young boy. He lives with one of his relatives, but he is lonely and every night watches a woman who lives across their building. It seems! that he wants her. He is one of the youths who are not good at communication with the opposite sex. However, he likes that woman, when the woman comes to his house with a man, Tomek gets pain. Then, we understand that Kieslowski tells us a story about an isolated young boy who needs a female to flirt or who falls in love with a mature woman. He does not do something else, because may be he knows that it is his salvation. One day, he stops that woman, suddenly, he seems a shy boy, but proves that he is not, so he explains her almost everything. She lectures and refuses him. Everything is so realistic like the other Kieslowski films, no problem. The problems start when Tomek visits her, the story of a lonely young boy who falls in love with a mature woman (but an unrequited love) turns into the story of a lonely young boy falls in love with a mature woman, at the beginnings the woman refuses, but after a short time, she starts to change her mind. This U-Turn makes the movie clich\xc3\xa9 firstly. The personality of Tomek is weird? or a result of a poor observation? I disappointed with this character, this is my opinion and I will try to tell why. When he goes to her house, Magda treats him very friendly. She asks what do you want from me? To kiss me? to make love with me? to go out with me? At this point, I remember the people who say she is a femme fatale. See? Returning to the scene, Tomek rejects all the proposals. Why? Because he is shy? I don&#39;t think so, but his communication is blunt, OK. After the leg scene at home, some events make the movie misses its aim. I think that the aim of the movie is (should have been according to the story) to show us there are some people who suffer from lack of endearment and to save from this situation is not easy owing to lack of communication and being aloof especially for men. I mean that at this point, what does the movie say? It is blurred and disappointing. It is seen that he is not hunger for love or a female or sex. Then, what? And the suicide attempt scene support this weakness. So that he touches her legs, he wants to kill himself! By the way, as I mentioned before, some say Magda is a femme fatale. Totally not. She endeavors in order to make Tomek happy. Does she avoid having contact with him? No. Does she insult him? No. Does she amuse him? No. And Does she deceive him? No. She has some troubles with her (ex) lover, so she is not O.K. However, she does not take revenge for it from Tomek. She is not an angel, but not a femme fatale also.&#34;

b&#34;I can&#39;t believe some of the scores this film is getting on the IMDb website! Have I been issued with the Special Edition naff version? Edited by Dewhurst, produced by Bernard Matthews, this film should be housed in Battersea. I&#39;m sorry for all the UK-centric references but if you&#39;re elsewhere and you&#39;ve got no toenails to cut or you haven&#39;t got a beer mat collection to catalogue then this film might just be worth 90 mins of your remaining lifespan (as long as you haven&#39;t got any paint to watch drying). The plot has more holes than a pair of fishnet stockings and the direction and editing is astonishingly ham fisted. What on earth is Irons doing in this film?&#34;

b&#39;I like to think of myself as a bad movie connoisseur. I like to think that the films most people label as the worst of all time I can easily withstand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...there are exceptions. I can only recall three movies I have had the misfortune to see that I have repeatedly used the fast-forward button for large chunks of the story. Those movies are The Mighty Gorga, Night of the Seagulls, and this little crap, Deep Blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the world of Jaws ripoffs, this falls off the scale. Deep Blood doesn\&#39;t have the realistic storyline of the original Crocodile, nor the incredible effects of The Sea Serpent, nor the commentary of Tintorera. No, instead we are treated to a handful of teens from any random failed \&#39;80s public access sitcom battling bullies and the local sheriff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shark attacks are realized by quick cuts of documentary footage with actors thrashing about in the water, occasionally with a bit of what appears to be orange-ish paint thrown into the water. Not a minute of original shark footage exists in this celluloid waste dump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I, or somebody like me, would read a dismal review like this one and say &#34;cool, I gotta find a copy of this!&#34; That\&#39;s the same thought I had when I read another viewer\&#39;s review on this very site. How wrong I was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So...from one bad movie fan to another...let this collect dust on the shelf...grab Up From the Depths or The Great Alligator instead to satisfy your need for something evil lurking in the water.&#39;

b&#39;Recycled and predictable plot. The characters are as memorable as the story line. We came in few minutes late and only saw the end of the opening scene which turned out to be a good thing since it was too intense for a 3 and a 4 year old. Overall a disappointment.&#39;

b&#39;This could have been great. The voice-overs are exactly right and fit the characters to a T. One small problem though; the look of the characters, mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same. The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size. It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest star\&#39;s voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here. If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voice-over for this show and it looked too odd to be funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a few other problems, one being the family plot. The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into. Here we get too much annoying diversions, like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off. As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more &#34;Married with Children&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is it\&#39;s repetitiveness. Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others. Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of one-dimensional. Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what more can I say. There isn\&#39;t exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades.&#39;

b&#34;...But it definitely still only deserves 4/10 stars and no more. A moronic dumb kid&#39;s father is a fighter pilot who gets shot down by some Arab country. They never name the country in the movie, its really ridiculous, they just vaguely refer to some Arab nation, this movie is really ignorant like that. But Lamar from Revenge of the Nerds is in here, he is friends with the main character Doug Masters. Well, Doug Masters, who lives on an Air Force base, his father is an air force pilot, yet he fails to get into the air force academy, conceives of a plot (with help from his retarded friends) to steal two jets and go rescue his father. Yea, exactly - this is One of the Greatest Films Ever Made!!! Louis Gossett Jr is fantastic in his role. You can tell he basically wanted to smack the hell out of Doug Masters the whole movie. Well anyway, you can probably guess how the plot ends, I can&#39;t believe they made 3 sequels to this movie.&#34;

b&#39;OK, we were going along with the stereotypical bad orphanage experience and explaining to our son, adopted from Russia, that this was over-the-top acting and dramatization, so we could get to the dog playing soccer (since he plays soccer). But the last scene, in which the dog goes back to his original owner put my son over the edge and he cried for 15-20 minutes, &#34;he\&#39;s been replaced!!!!&#34; This from an elementary child. I DO NOT recommend this movie to any family that has an adopted child; it displays adoption, orphanages and adults badly--and in the end, even though they win the game--the dog that the boy bonded with has to leave--and this is too much. PLEASE be wary if you have any adopted children, and beware families with biological children, because the impression of children who are adopted is not positive and paints a stereotype that is unhealthy and nasty. (The dog is cute, but not enough to save our family\&#39;s reaction to this movie....)&#39;

b&#39;I had to write a review for this movie based on the ones that are saying gory, non stop action, great movie..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people were obviously watching a different movie. Killpoint honestly sucked from the word go!! I kept waiting and waiting for this film to get better and it was to no avail. Some said this movie was brutal and others said gory but I can\&#39;t find either of those adjectives actually showing up in this, I mean hell there are so many scenes with people getting shot and there being no blood at all it\&#39;s not even funny!! I guess the best way to sum this up is it probably should\&#39;ve been rated PG by 1984 standards and now in the year 2010 there is no doubt this would be PG!! Bad, BAD not in the fun cheesy &#34;B&#34; variety movie!!&#39;

b&#39;They did it again: ripped off an old show\&#39;s title, then destroyed the nostalgia with boring &#34;re-imagined&#34; stuff. The \&#39;60\&#39;s cartoon was one of the funniest of its time, a good-natured satire of super hero comic books. The character was drawn as 1/2 way between animal and human, the way Mickey Mouse is. Here they use a real beagle; that\&#39;s about the same as making a Mickey Mouse watch with a real rat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the clever schtick that made the original show funny is missing from this film. Instead, we get a clumsy ex-police dog who\&#39;s even dumber than Cad. And some pet owners who add nothing to the story. Cheesy effects (the dog-talking animation is embarrassing). Poor scripting. A stereotyped dwarf playing Simon Bar Sinister. The gravelly noise box guy they hired to voice Underdog is painful. You\&#39;d think they\&#39;d at least gotten a voice impressionist to approximate Wally Cox\&#39;s humorously distinctive voice for Underdog. But no. There are, at least, a few affectionate references to the source material (such as the rhyming lines), which lift it to a 4. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only small children that love dogs may enjoy this. Everybody else should get a DVD of the original cartoon series. Watch this only in desperation.&#39;

b&#39;OK we have 4 city electricians who find a mini nuke reactor, turn it in and fall into a parallel universe inhabited by a Giant spider queen also from a parallel universe, who managed to slip through with a few of her kin to take over the earth, but alas she is the only one left? If so why did not the rest of humanity join up and hunt her down. Also what happened to the military, no way a few billion plus round of ammo could have been used up and why hide out in a basement when a lot more defensible places had to available. Also not a dig on city workers, but how is it they knew what a mini nuke reactor looked like and how if they did not have one in the parallel universe, could they reopen the rift? Sorry but there was nothing likable about the movie&#39;

b&#34;This movie is like porn with all of the good parts removed. It&#39;s like all of the porn stars that didn&#39;t want to fulfill their obligations banded together around this awful, trite, useless piece of gargoyle abstinence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a helpful movie if you&#39;re in the mood to torture a loved (or no longer loved) one. It&#39;s important that, if you choose to use this movie as a method of torture, that you put in earplugs and put on a blindfold to keep yourself from going insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had a choice between this movie and The 700 Club...I&#39;d choose Girls Gone Wild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, better if you&#39;ve been drinking.

b&#39;The war in the East,as the Germans referred to the WW2 Soviet-Nazi conflict, was a war of annihilation on the part of the Germany. 90% of the German army were in the Soviet Union fighting. Their ultimate aim was to wipe out the so called &#34;sub human (Untermensch)&#34; Russian population and colonize the mainly empty country with German settlers after they had won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read &#34;Hitler\&#39;s Willing Executioners.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we have the German army presented as innocent victims and not as Nazi mass murderers.

b&#39;One would make you believe that this game is about a man obsessed with a number. And sure, it\&#39;s an interesting subject - can a person become so obsessed by something marginal as a simple number that he completely loses touch with reality and becomes hopelessly delusional and paranoid? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, perhaps someone will make a movie about that sometime. This one unfortunately doesn\&#39;t have anything to do with the above, never mind what the trailers (or even the movie itself) would like you to believe. I would like to say that this number is just a MacGuffin, but it isn\&#39;t even that. It\&#39;s pointless. A gimmick. A hook for unsuspecting audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well what IS the movie about? A dog-catcher (Carrey) who becomes obsessed with a cheesy noir crime book because he feels it somehow reflects his own life. There. Sure, the character in the book - detective Fingerling (sigh) - is (for some reason) obsessed with number 23, and Carrey himself becomes obsessed and starts seeing the number everywhere.. but it\&#39;s just padding, and totally irrelevant to the story. In fact, you can cut out all the 23 references and have the main character(s) obsess about cheese or something and you\&#39;ll have the exactly same story. It is painfully obvious that all the &#34;23&#34; stuff was written in waay after the story was already finished, rejected and sent for &#34;rewrites&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which would be OK.. I guess.. if the movie wasn\&#39;t dull, dull, dull. Half of the movie is narrated, for chrissakes. You aren\&#39;t watching the movie, you are listening to Jim Carrey narrating the movie. About a quarter-in Carrey starts reading the book, and from then until the horribly clich\xc3\xa9 ending we are forced to watch &#34;real-life&#34; scenes from dog-catcher\&#39;s life (where nothing happens) interspersed with narrated artsy film noir-ish &#34;book&#34; scenes which will either leave you snickering or just plain depressed. It\&#39;s like a poor man\&#39;s &#34;Sin City&#34; with all the violence cut out, narrated by Carrey and shown in slow-motion. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a simple case of a C-movie script somehow being filmed with an A-movie cast.. probably because of the &#34;number 23&#34; hook which I guess sounded intriguing enough on paper to warrant the premium Hollywood treatment. However, since - as I said already - the movie is about number 23 as much as it is about cheese production in Switzerland, one cannot feel anything but cheated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give &#34;Fingerling - the movie&#34; 3 out of 10, because I guess it didn\&#39;t insult my intelligence as much as &#34;Forsaken&#34; did or made me downright suicidal like &#34;Battlefield Earth&#34; did and the bottom of the scale must be reserved for abominations like those. But fear not, this is still a pretty lousy flick.&#39;

b&#39;I see this movie as a poor tribute to the old slasher movies. Because it really doesn\&#39;t hold a candle to the 70\&#39;s and 80\&#39;s gold-era of horror, this is of course where personal taste comes in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie just falls into the category of &#34;New generation of slashers&#34; in my book, the cast is the typical ones 18-24 years and potential models. I\&#39;m personally quite tired of that image in horror movies, the old movies at least had some variation in people. One or more fat people, and dorks in general. Just plain looking persons, of course having a couple of good lookers is fine they always been there. But when the entire cast is just a bunch of nice racks and butts it\&#39;s getting silly. I mean, OK yeah i like to watch HOT chicks. But not in a horror that is supposed to reflect some ordinary people getting hunted down by for example a knife-wielding maniac... You expect the people being hunted to look something like any random person you see on the street. I think. There are of course a few movies with just good lookers that is perfectly alright, but they aren\&#39;t many. &#34;Wrong turn&#34; is one example of the better ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next point is the killing scenes that slashers should be all about. In this poor movie, all you get to see is 2-3 frames of sudden high pitched sound/scream and music in crescendo. And that\&#39;s it. The little you do get to see isn\&#39;t very graphical at all, not for people who have seen some horrors during the years. The old-school slashers compared to this had much more and better death, blood and gore. Not to mention the killers in those movies, who surpassed the one you\&#39;ll get to see here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for true horror fans it is more fun and exciting to watch horrors with new approaches because of the originalities that pops up, the killer in this one doesn\&#39;t add anything new and fresh to the genre in my opinion. I have to agree with what someone previously stated as well, the CGI is something i hate to watch. Personally i preffere the makeups in that sense I\&#39;m conservative, (unless the CGI is really well done). But most importantly is to set a good setting of mood which allows you to &#34;get into the movie&#34;, a good background story is one very good thing. Also revealing and explaining too much of everything in a movie to the viewers takes away all sense of mystic that adds very much of the mood, and doesn\&#39;t give you much to think about. Just as an example: keeping the killers background a complete mystery for the viewer is a good move in many cases. I mean if everything about the story or the people in it has to be explained or shown in detail, then it\&#39;s not much content left over for the viewer at all to ponder about... That\&#39;s like watching a porno movie and hope for a great story in the meantime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the old-school slashers still works, at least for some people. Is because they are established cult movies from the era when they were a new thing, making new ones of that sort today is admittedly hard. The exception might be for people who are newer to that sort of horrors of course. I have noticed that many people does like this sort of horror movies, so there are of course not &#34;A right taste&#34; for horror movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for people out there that might share my opinion; here you have a frame of reference what to expect of this flick.&#39;

b&#39;Heart of Darkness Movie Review Joseph Conrad\&#39;s Heart of Darkness is pretty dark, deep, and very profound. I would have to say reading the novel is way better than the movie. The character Mr. Kurtz, played by John Malcovik was totally the wrong actor to do the part. He fit the character in &#34;Of Mice and Men.&#34; The movie left out man key parts that I consider important to get the true message of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is poorly edited. It shows a lot of non-important and annoying flashes. In the novel it has a very suspenseful atmosphere, but in the movie it lacks that kind of feeling. In the book there is so much that was left to the imagination of the reader. For example when Marlow spent timeless hours and days waiting for rivets and that entire scene was left out of the movie. In the novel Marlow waited very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat. This was a big source of futility in the novel. The movie added more parts that were useless and kind of didn\&#39;t make sense. For example, when Kurtz was talking to Marlow at the end of the book and Kurtz snapped the monkey\&#39;s neck and killed him. That kind of just ruined everything, didn\&#39;t make any sense to me what so ever. So my suggestion to you is don\&#39;t view the movie, just read the book. You will understand more and have a better interpretation of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Chris C.&#39;

b&#39;I think &#34;Rosemary\&#39;s Baby&#34; is the most overrated horror film out there. Not scary, interesting or much of anything. It\&#39;s reasonably well-directed and Ruth Gordon was wonderful but that\&#39;s about it. But this sequel makes it look like &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I caught this on TV back when I was 14. Unfortunately, I still remember it. From what I remember Rosemary\&#39;s baby Andrew is now grown up and the coven wants him to start taking over (the world that is). But there are forces trying to stop it...and Andrew is having doubts himself...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m giving this a 2 for a few reasons: Gordon is in this (and still very good); Stephen McHattie was actually pretty good as Andrew and there is one spooky moment at the beginning with Rosemary (Patty Duke) being &#34;kidnapped&#34; by a bus...with no driver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that it\&#39;s dull, silly and needless. The original didn\&#39;t NEED a sequel! Ira Levin\&#39;s book followup in 1999 wasn\&#39;t much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tune in for the beginning with Duke...then tune out. Not worth the effort.&#39;

b&#39;Just saw this movie on opening night. I read some other user comments which convinced me to go see it... I must say, I was not impressed. I\&#39;m so unimpressed that I feel the need to write this comment to spare some of you people some money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all &#34;The Messengers&#34; is very predictable, and just not much of a thriller. It might be scary for someone under 13, but it really did nothing for me. The climax was laughable and most of the audience left before the movie\&#39;s resolution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore the acting seemed a little superficial. Some of the emotional arguments between the family were less convincing than the sub-par suspense scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you\&#39;ve seen previews for this movie, then you\&#39;ve seen most of the best parts and have a strong understanding of the plot. This movie is not worth seeing in the theaters.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;d heard a lot of bad things about this film before seeing it, but thought all the negative comments were probably down to the film&#39;s low budget and poor acting - both of which I can deal with when it comes to zombie films. However, what I didn&#39;t count on is this film being really, really boring; if there&#39;s one thing you can count on from low budget zombies, its gore and entertainment - but unfortunately, this film has neither. I&#39;m quite surprised, because the previous two horror films I&#39;ve seen from director Bob Clark - Deathdream and Black Christmas - were both highly inventive and entertaining films, but Children Shouldn&#39;t Play with Dead Things just doesn&#39;t cut it. The plot line follows a group of young adults that travel to a burial island in order to mess about with rituals to bring the dead back to life. However, they soon learn that playing with things they don&#39;t understand is a really stupid idea when their rituals actually bring the dead back to life and the corpses of the island return to feast on their blood!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plots sounds like it could lead to a decent flick, but what I didn&#39;t mention is that the interesting parts don&#39;t start until the final twenty minutes; and as this is a ninety minute movie, I&#39;m sure you can guess that this isn&#39;t a good thing. The opening hour and ten minutes are padded out with poor acting and even worse characters. I can understand setting up a situation so that the horror is more potent once it comes along; but please, if you&#39;re going to spend so long on it, you&#39;ve really got to make it interesting. All of the characters in the film are over the top and annoying, and personally I just wanted the zombies to hurry up and eat them. The film is not without its merits, however, as the atmosphere is a standout. Lucio Fulci would show seven years later how an isolated island and flesh eating zombies can blend well; but Bob Clark already did it with this film. The direction isn&#39;t bad either, but it&#39;s brought down by poor make-up effects and a distinct lack of blood, which isn&#39;t likely to please fans of zombie movies. Overall, I really can&#39;t recommend this film; but if you&#39;re a hardcore zombie fanatic, you may get a kick out of it.&#34;

b&#34;This movie made my face hurt. I don&#39;t understand it...things just happened, inexplicably, and they usually resulted in someone bursting into a song and dance number. I don&#39;t understand how people can laud this film with praise. There are B-movies, and then there are B-musicals, and then there is Rockula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The songs made me want to run headlong into a wall. The only saving grace is that one of the musical explosions turns out to be a musical video, which eases the pain, yet still fails to justify why it needed to exist. The most frightening section of the film is Toni Basil&#39;s creep-dance that accompanies her weird song. But on the bright side, she can manages to find the notes that she is looking for, unlike pop music sensations Rockula (aka Rapula) and Mona...wow, can we say tone deaf. So if you want to question life for about 90 minutes, see this film. If you hate your life, then buy it.&#34;
b&#39;1.0&#39;
b&#39;The only reason there is a question mark in parenthesis is NOT because I haven\&#39;t seen every film released in 2001 thus far. It\&#39;s because this film was only made PARTLY in 2001. The rest of it was stolen from Roger Corman\&#39;s OTHER dinosaur films, Carnosaur 1-3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a confession to make. &#34;Carnosaur 2&#34; is perhaps one of my favorite B-movies. It borrows so much from James Cameron\&#39;s &#34;Aliens&#34; it\&#39;s not even funny. But I love it. I can\&#39;t explain exactly why. It just WORKS for me. I liked the sets, I liked the cinematography, I liked how they borrowed from &#34;Aliens&#34;. It\&#39;s all a bit ironic that Cameron at one point was an understudy of Corman\&#39;s, with films like &#34;Battle Beyond the Stars&#34; (1980).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own the Carnosaur trilogy on DVD, and the most I can say for part one is that it has moments. The most I can say for the third is that it took me five years to find it watchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now we have &#34;Raptor,&#34; which does NOT continue that series. Instead, it borrows ENTIRE scenes from the Carnosaur Trilogy and BUILDS a movie around it. And somehow Roger Corman was able to get Eric Roberts and Corbin Bernsen to do it. Now, I\&#39;m not saying either Roberts or Bernsen are at any kind of career high. But they were both at one point what could be called RESPECTABLE actors. Not here. Sure, actors react to effects they won\&#39;t even see while filming all the time. Here, however, they are reacting to mismatched footage from films that are between five and eight years old. There\&#39;s even a sherrif whose costume was modeled directly after a character in &#34;Carnosaur 1.&#34; Apparently it made too much sense to get the original guy back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When &#34;Raptor&#34; was announced I was a wee bit excited. I was however disappointed when Corman said that they\&#39;d be using the old dinosaur models from &#34;Carnosaur.&#34; Apparently Corman decided after this interview was conducted that he wouldn\&#39;t even do that. And its not that he couldn\&#39;t find an FX crew to do it. The script for this was clearly written keeping in mind that the story had to be built around pre-existing stock footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t compare this to Ed Wood. Ed did better than this. At least he only used the stock footage of Bela once, in one film. There are ways of incorporating stock footage into a movie, and &#34;Raptor&#34; takes this frowned-upon technique to a new low. Even if you liked &#34;Carnosaur 3: Primal Species,&#34; stay away from &#34;Raptor.&#34;&#39;

b&#39;Oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: David Hasselhoff. The 80\&#39;s are back with vengeance in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production, helmed by infamous Joe \&#39;D\&#39;Amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) Fabrizio Laurenti directing . Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi\&#39;s Evil Dead series in Italy (that was dubbed &#34;La Casa&#34; in there), Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it\&#39;s progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious WTF surprise climax. (I just love the look on her face...) Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80\&#39;s Italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. I only felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently haven\&#39;t been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. Don\&#39;t expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you\&#39;ll experience at least some mild fun. It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80\&#39;s euro gore horror. And speaking of hearts - every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, MUST have it\&#39;s one on the right place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my truth - what is yours?&#39;

b&#34;Michael Dudikoff stars as Joe Armstrong a martial artist who fights ninjas who are stealing weapons from the U.S Army, in this entertaining yet admittedly brainless martial arts actioner, which is hampered by too many long pauses without action, but helped by some high energy action setpieces as well as Steve James&#39; performance.&#34;

I saw this film recently on tape and I was glad I didn&#39;t spent any money to rent it. It&#39;s basically a poor attempt at film-making. I won&#39;t even bother to tell you the story. Story?

b&#39;I went into this movie with very little in terms of expectations. I went with my girlfriend and two friends, and none of them could explain the story of the Grudge 1 to me. Well, if the first one couldn\&#39;t leave an impression on them to explain the plot, then I doubted this one would be any better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me summarize what the trailers let you know: The Asian lady is back and so is Sarah Michelle Gellar. Luckily for her, she isn\&#39;t around very long. That decision may have saved her career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie has three story lines, and none of them make sense. And even worse, none of them are developed. You almost start to understand, and then someone dies and the story gets left behind. Okay, killing people could be scary, but I was left more confused over the attempted plot development than I was frightened. They jump back and forth between all three story lines, which aren\&#39;t related... OR ARE THEY?!?! *SOUND EFFECTTT*~~~ The timing of the three stories are displaced, and you can tell right at the start that the movie is going to have a twist at the end. BE PREPAREDDD. Oh Wait. Sorry, this isn\&#39;t a Fight Club or Vertigo quality twist, you could see this one coming from miles away. And probably envisioned a MUCH better twist in your head... they should\&#39;ve hired me. Instead of the girl making her &#34;SURPRISING&#34; appearance, maybe it could\&#39;ve been Michael Jackson instead? That part of Scary Movie 4 scared the crap out of me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The killing sequences were terribly done. Unlike horror movies of the past, where a killer pops out of nowhere, a closet or behind a door for example, and everyone in the theatre jumps (and subsequently the fat guy behind you spills popcorn down your neck)- this lacked any frightening pop ups. They zoomed in on where the random Asian woman or kid would show up, and you knew exactly what was coming. Instead of having the music get really loud, then quiet, then a pop out to psyche you out, the music actually gave you timing for the scary scene. If I know it\&#39;s coming, it won\&#39;t scare me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie began with explaining what the &#34;Grudge&#34; is; when a person is killed during a fit of rage, a curse is placed on the location where she was killed. So why does the Asian lady being cursed by her mother have any significance to the story? And why is the grudge now moving countries? This movie was absolutely terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All it did was leave me begrudging my friends for making me go- we should\&#39;ve seen one of those animated Pixar movies. It would\&#39;ve been scarier.&#39;

b&#39;This really is the worst movie I have ever seen. For a while, I made a habit of watching lousy movies, including &#34;Battlefield Earth&#34;, &#34;Delta Force Commando&#34; and &#34;Starship&#34;. All of these movies are cinematic gems compared to Ironheart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn\&#39;t much point in summarizing this piece of junk; I think it\&#39;s more beneficial to summarize my reaction to the movie, which is as follows: I become furiously angry and I want to rip the tape out of the VCR and burn it after (roughly) 80 minutes of play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this movie a 0, but IMDb does not let one rate a movie less than 1. I give it a 0 knowing full well that I am saying any movie that has any score above 0 is infinitely (undefinably) many times better than this one - That\&#39;s really how bad it is.&#39;

b&#39;The other day I showed my boyfriend a great movie, Stand By Me, a movie I have shown to many people and they absolutely adored it, but for some odd reason he didn\&#39;t like it. He lends me a movie called Backdraft and he tells me that he\&#39;s shown it to many people and they loved it, instead I hated this movie. I don\&#39;t think I\&#39;ve hated a movie so much in a while, how this movie has even a 6.6 rating is beyond me. I couldn\&#39;t keep up with the five million stories here: Billy Baldwin becoming a fire man, the random sibling rivalry, the random love story(s), the who\&#39;s being an arson story, the investigator, the fire who has a personality of it\&#39;s own. I just have a problem that this movie can\&#39;t keep up with all these stories, they didn\&#39;t balance out well enough make the film interesting. I would have just preferred if this movie was about being a firefighter or the investigator and how he came to be one or what it is exactly he does and why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie tells the story of a group of Chicago firefighters, two brothers. Stephen &#34;Bull&#34; McCaffrey, the elder brother, is obsessed with the beating of the fires that he fights. Brian, the younger brother quit the fire fighting academy school several years before, then embarking on a number of other unsuccessful careers before returning to become a firefighter. He is looked down on by his elder brother who expects him to fail in his newly chosen career as a fire fighter. Donald &#34;Shadow&#34; Rimgale is an arson investigator who is dedicated to his profession. He is called in because a number of fires that have occurred have somewhat similar connections. .Martin Swayzak is an alderman on the City Council. He has obvious hopes of being elected to mayor, but has had to make a number of budget cuts to the fire department. Many of the rank and file firemen believe that the cuts that he has made are endangering the lives of the firefighters. However, Swayzak is initially successful in portraying the fire department as bloated and ineffectual after firemen are repeatedly being killed in blazes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just couldn\&#39;t get into this movie, I don\&#39;t know how anyone else could, it was incredibly unrealistic and portrayed firefighters all wrong. I loved how they had every action clich\xc3\xa9 in the book to match this action flick. I just felt also like there was great talent wasted on such mediocre roles, Donald Sutherland, great actor, but such a strange role that could have been taken by a lesser known man who had the upcoming talent at the time. I know Ron was going for great quality, but I think him casting such huge actors in small roles was a mistake for this film. I even had to joke my way through while watching this movie commenting how the doctor in the background was probably Kevin Spacey. The fire was so unrealistic and the movie was just so out there, I didn\&#39;t enjoy it and honestly wouldn\&#39;t recommend it to people, I\&#39;ll stick to the recommendations in my relationship from this point on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#39;

b&#34;Poorly acted, poorly written and poorly directed. Special effects are cheap. Best performance is by Yvette Napir, but that&#39;s not saying much. Story is a confusing mess about corporate greed leading to sabotage of a space station and an attempt to rescue those stranded aboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; There is little suspense and even less action. There&#39;s one car chase that&#39;s not bad, but the rest of the movie is simply a waste of everyone&#39;s time.&#34;

b&#39;Orson Welles\&#39; 1974 documentary &#34;F for Fake&#34; examines trickery and fraud, mainly focusing on two men who have been exposed as frauds themselves. Clifford Irving is a biographer who wrote the allegedly fraudulent Howard Hughes autobiography, yet, at least it seems, purports his innocence. The other main subject of the film is artist Elmyr de Hory, a man who has spent his life painting fakes of famous masterpieces, sometimes selling them to museums as real works by the original artists. Interspersed among these stories are bits where Welles does magic tricks to illustrate points, etc., and he also addresses the fact that his career began as a fraud when he first lied on his resume and then created a radio sensation with &#34;War of the Worlds&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to love this film and find it profound since I am such a Welles devotee, but I couldn\&#39;t bring myself to do it. Part of the problem lied with the fact that it was not just non-linear, it was completely scattered. While I appreciate stylish editing and quick jumps and zooms, particularly when used in an unusual format such as a documentary, there was simply too much of it going on in &#34;F for Fake&#34;. They created a distraction as opposed to lending style. If the story had been more clear and comprehensive, I think that the editing probably would not have been as annoying. The scattered storytelling was made all the more obnoxious by the fact that these were truly interesting subjects, particularly Elmyr de Hory. His artistic fakery brings up the topic of fraud in the art world, and who is truly able to determine the authenticity of certain works; and if the works are not authentic, what does it say about those who admire the pieces in museums? This is one documentary that I would say to at least give a shot, but don\&#39;t be afraid to turn it off if you\&#39;re not enjoying it. It is certainly the most discombobulated documentary I have ever seen; it is a cross between a documentary, an art film and experimental film, none of which is properly represented or isolated. I don\&#39;t have any lesser opinion of Welles after seeing it, but it certainly, in my opinion, doesn\&#39;t stand out as a glowing specimen in his oeuvre. 4/10 --Shelly&#39;

b&#34;Honestly, one of the worst written, directed and acted movies I have ever seen. Seemed like a made-for-TV movie. And a bad one at that. I cannot believe that people are still hiring Danny Huston after seeing him in this movie, or that they are still allowing John Sayles to make films. My husband and I came across this movie on TV one night and got so bored with it, we ended up cleaning the house while it was on . . . and it still bored us! It made me think that critics have been so gullible with Sayles&#39; previous films, such as Lone Star, which was raved about at he time but didn&#39;t really add up to much in the end. Spend your time on something better. Anything.&#34;

b&#39;I was a teenager when this first appeared in theaters, and I saw it in Japan. The film\&#39;s plot wasn\&#39;t my cup of tea as a high school sophomore, but I went to see it for the 3-D process. It had been ballyhooed in the press so that even service personnel overseas had heard of it, though it never screened at the Post theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film started the trend of throwing objects at the audience, which was taken to absurd levels with later 3-D films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don\&#39;t know whether this qualifies as a spoiler, but you\&#39;ve been warned if it is. In many films of the time, actors would often work in front of a &#34;rear projection screen,&#34; where backgrounds could be projected to make it appear that they were in a different environment, such as a jungle background when the actors were actually on a sound stage. This works well on regular films, but when seen in 3-D, they look like a flat scene behind the actors. There were several scenes in the film where rear projection was used, and it didn\&#39;t work well in the theaters. If seen in 3-D, it will constitute another disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film\&#39;s only importance is historical, since it was the first of its kind.&#39;

b&#34;...Or better yet, watch Fandango if you want to see a really intelligent and funny male college age road flick. Rolling Kansas sounded promising (in fact the program guide gave it 2.5 out of 4 stars which usually means it&#39;s fairly watchable) but I pretty much fast-forwarded through it. Usually road trip movies have great music, but I can&#39;t even recall whether there was music. The only high point was a small role with Rip Torn as a wise old hitchhiker/guru. Otherwise the jokes and timing missed all along the way. The four main characters are unknown actors and I don&#39;t remember seeing any of them in another movie. (Oh, yeah, I see that Thos. Hayden Church was in it, but he&#39;s in everything, good, bad or indifferent). This movie is about as funny as watching someone else stoned when you&#39;re not.&#34;

b&#39;The idea of bringing Dracula to contemporary times isn\&#39;t bad--after all, it might revive the series a bit by injecting a new story element into a series that Hammer has all but exhausted in a long series of generally excellent movies. However, because the present day turned out to be the crappy early 1970s, the results were pretty silly and looked more like LOVE AT FIRST BITE (a deliberate comedy). Seeing Christopher Lee in a film filled with 70s hip lingo and electric guitar chords and laughable rock music just seemed beyond stupid. To make matters worse, the acting is much more over-the-top here--with an intense and silly performance by &#34;Johnny Alucard&#34;. I also thought it was really funny that it took Van Helsing\&#39;s grandson to notice that &#34;Alucard&#34; is &#34;Dracula&#34; spelled backwards--no one else figured this out for themselves! Wow, what cunning!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So because so much of the movie was bad, why did it still earn an almost respectable score of 4? Well, when the story came to the expected showdown between Van Helsing (Peter Cushing) and Drac (Christopher Lee), it was exciting and ended very well. Additionally, and I know this will sound very sexist, but if I had to watch a bad film, at least Stephanie Beacham\&#39;s character wore some really nice outfits that revealed her ample....&#34;talents&#34;, so to speak. So at least it was a pretty film to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, the film ends with the phrase &#34;may he rest in FINAL peace&#34; at the end, though this was not the final Hammer Dracula film with Lee. He returned for &#34;The Satanic Rites of Dracula&#34; just a short time later and it was in many ways even worse than this dud of a monster film.&#39;

b&#34;the worst sequel I&#39;ve ever seen. really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is! also, which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful. it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again. but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny. but the fact it was her 50th birthday: why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old? i was going to give this a 1 but now i think... i might give it a 2. but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film . it is similar without the humour from certain characters. Overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music, the severe lack of voice talent: having changed the voice of prince Derek and jean bob, the new villains, disappointing storyline the annoying habits of some characters, and the very simple animation.&#34;

b&#39;Ugh, bad, bad, bad, but I have seen worse which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1. Just got finished watching this movie and I thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on Dr. Chopper\&#39;s face. The worst line of the movie had to be &#34;I like to introduce you to someone... meet my inner b*tch&#34; which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at Dr. Chopper and then falling on the stage. Second worst line, &#34;I\&#39;m the park ranger that\&#39;s gonna f*ck you up&#34; What, this freak ain\&#39;t even a cop????? Did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab (no one dies that quick from a gut stab, I know this cause I see them frequently in the operating room) except super park ranger. Dude had like a bucket of blood poor out of that wound, writhes around on the floor some, and then comes in for the finale to take a parting shot at Dr. Chopper while inner b*tch lies cowering on the floor. And if that don\&#39;t beat all, he doesn\&#39;t even have the decency to die then like everyone else. Inner b*tch helps him limp outside and proceeds to tell him not to die while she runs for help cause he\&#39;s like her only friend left alive now. Since when did these two become friends? I don\&#39;t think a frantic meeting in the woods where he tells you to head for the city qualifies as getting to know you time but whatever. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only watch this movie if there\&#39;s nothing else own and you have nothing else to do with your time.&#39;

b&#39;To keep from being bored during &#34;Love and Sex,&#34; first I tried to think of all the movies this was imitative of: &#34;Breaking Up&#34; with Russell Crowe and Salma Hayek (though that had a more original ending), &#34;About Last Night&#34; with Rob Lowe, and a lot of TV shows. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second was admiring just how gorgeous Framke Janssen is so I couldn\&#39;t believe for a nanosecond that she could have a problem getting a date. She is certainly in line to give Julia Roberts a run for her money, literally-- and wasn\&#39;t Julia in some movie with this same plot or other? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third was trying to figure out why the writer/director bothered to give Jon Favreau\&#39;s character the Jewish name of Adam Levy; he even refers admiringly to eating a ham sandwich.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourth was trying to figure out why some critics had given this a good review which is why I was in the theater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(originally written 9/2/2000)&#39;

b&#39;I was looking for ATTACK on Precinct 13. There, the film is THAT memorable. Who is the star of this? Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can\&#39;t tell who the lead actor is, that\&#39;s a pretty big point against the movie right there) Gabriel Byrne (who could\&#39;t have needed the money this badly could he?) Drea De Matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body. It took me ages to finally work out she\&#39;s Joey\&#39;s sister off &#34;Friends&#34;. I agree that the so called SWAT people attacking the station are pretty crap, as far as tactics go. We were even taught better basic skills than this in RAF basic training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avoid this, even the snow doesn\&#39;t want to fall on a bus full of prisoners!

b&#34;It&#39;s incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable. For those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe. Simply because Predator Island contains none of this. It is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades. Now I appreciate bad horror films, they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances. However, if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the Cult Hall of Fame then my first suggestion is to find some imagination/creativity plus get some talent. Oh, and a few extra bucks to put into your picture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One horror film tradition has been to shock the audience with violent deaths and gore. However, shock doesn&#39;t deliver for more than a few seconds. To really evoke a satisfying reaction from paying crowd there should b development of characters, some identifiable traits. I know, you&#39;re probably saying this guy is not providing anything intelligent to the filmmakers, he&#39;s just stating an amateur remark. Well, that goes to show you how amateur these filmmakers are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite having to go through the horror of watching this movie, there was a silver lining. The performance by Dan Gordon as Chris is splendid. He is given nothing to work with in a script and yet he is able to come out of that film looking like a star. Out of all of the actors he is the only who believes in what he is reciting. He not only provides the audience with someone we can identify with but we also have someone we look forward to watching so we can get through the rest of the film. Gordon shows genuine talent and the ability to pull off quality work and overcoming a huge obstacle, that being the rest of the cast. Dan Gordon is going to be a star, hopefully sooner than later. That is to say if he can get away films like this that will hold him back.&#34;

b&#39;I had high hopes for this one after reading earlier reviews but it was so slow and the plot so basic that well I wondered if I had read the wrong reviews. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please, a boy meets girl next door at 11 and both aspire to love and being basketball legends. Grow apart, but watch each others progress. Guess what! Both get scholarships to same university and become lovers again until his father is caught out playing around with a younger woman. Our young hero unable to cope has lapse in court concentration but some how decides to go pro and drop studies, and guess what is picked up by Lakers. Dumps the heroine because she was not there for him during this emotional period. So for 5 years they go their own way. She returns from Spain having lost the zest for the game and our hero is getting married in two weeks. Mom tells her that she should fight for her love so she professes her on-going love and challenges him to a basketball shootout. He wins he marries she wins he loves her. Well he won but decides to dump other girl for our girl. The End has her playing basketball and he has baby duties. Sorry 2 is my high score. My partner she scored 0 for a soapy story for those who read Mills and Boon&#39;

b&#39;This is supposed to be Charlie\&#39;s masterpiece, but I will contend that it is actually one of his weaker films. First of all, it\&#39;s not funny. Not one thing in this movie made me laugh. Okay, there\&#39;s a quick jump into a box that was a giggle, but that was one of desperation. The Tramp\&#39;s first - and only - talkie where he speaks (he sings in an earlier film), but his flat dialogue shows us exactly why he was such a joy to watch in &#34;Modern Times&#34; and &#34;Gold Rush&#34; - two films that are at least ten times better than this film. There\&#39;s literally only one good scene in this film, the one where Hitler plays with the globe like a beach ball. That\&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so it gets a lot of praise for being the first film to wage war, even long before we entered the war. Nope. Not true. Simply not true, so that praise can be turned down a bit. The Three Stooges did it on January 19, 1940 with &#34;You Natzy Spy&#34; - ten months earlier than the October release of Chaplin\&#39;s film - and that movie was actually funny! If you want to watch Chaplin\&#39;s greatest film, watch this only for reference. And then pop in &#34;Modern Times&#34;, &#34;Gold Rush&#34;, &#34;City Lights&#34;, &#34;Limelight&#34;, &#34;The Kid&#34;, or even &#34;Tillie\&#39;s Punctured Romance&#34;.&#39;

Ouffcourz , rock enroll life is only sex drugs and parties and tons of supermodels trying to ride with you. Say it to stupid young boys. The filmmakers seemed to have read too much Guns&#39;n&#39;Roses or Motley Crue stories. I have seen everyday life of usual rock band closely and there are nothing to do with reality in this movie. If you are successful enough your life is touring touring touring. Its means that you are mostly in a bus and trying to sleep. Just sleep. Because you must be fresh, sober and clean in evenings. After live you have a little time to discharge your stage excitement. Then you have a bit time to have fun. But its not any luxury or dream. Artistically this film was zero. Stupid characters and idiotic dialogs. The ending of movie was funny -- main character left heavy metal band and formed a grunge band! Yeah, what a moral. Real 90s.&#34;

b&#39;I work in an office on weekends, and there is a TV that only gets ONE channel. So, I don\&#39;t have the option of turning to something better. I keep it on, though, because it provides a little background noise. Sometimes, I get a decent movie/show. Not today. Today, I got &#34;Breaker Breaker.&#34; The city looks like a third rate set (which, of course, it is). All the actors and bad guys look like they just graduated from stuntman school. I have seen better dramatic enactments at a carnival. The special effects (flames at end of movie are more fake then Michael Jacksons masculinity). Even the horse at the end of the movie was a terrible actor... A badly acted, badly shot, badly written movie.&#39;

b&#34;Unforgiven is Clint Eastwoods last tribute to the once great west. But whilst i thought this was going to be good and raise the bar for future westerns to come i was sadly mistaken. Unforgiven, though simple in plot it falls flat on characters and emotions and i would certainly say that Unforgiven is Eastwoods worst film to date. Eastwoods himself seems too old to play the part of acting and directing which also adds a downfall to the overall look of the film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the characters seem rushed and ragged around the edges especially Eastwoods character. The acting doesn&#39;t seem to flow and contribute to what the characters are feeling. The direction is poorly misled by quirky shots. So overall Unforgiven is not Eastwoods best and by far one of the worst westerns around.&#34;

b&#34;This is just dreadful. I regret every second of the 80 minutes I spent watching this dreck. I think it&#39;s supposed to be a comedy, but I don&#39;t remember laughing much, except at a few blatant inconsistencies and downright glaring errors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An unattractive middle-aged man called Lester meets up with rich unattractive middle-aged women via lonely hearts ads, and then murders them for the money he needs to feed his gambling addiction. That&#39;s the whole plot, and that&#39;s really all that happens. Along the way there is an attempt at intrigue when Lester starts to get phone calls from a mysterious stranger who taunts him about knowing his secret, but its so badly implemented, you may not realise what is actually supposed to be happening. The sequences in which Lester murders the rich widows are all quite brutal but also seemingly dressed up as comedies. One sequence has a woman bludgeoned with a wooden pole and then shoved into an oven. It&#39;s very cruelly depicted, but it is played out against blaring big-band waltz music, with Lester pulling faces and adopting comedy poses throughout. Another scene has the victim murdered while she constantly sings shrill opera songs...you have to see this to believe it! Actually - you don&#39;t have to see it at all, in fact I strongly recommend you avoid this flop. Fulci does not seem to know which hat he is wearing and there&#39;s no evidence of any of the flair seen in his earlier career. One sequence stood out to me as particularly wretched: the revelation when Lester suddenly realises that he has no shadow. Fulci seems unable to think up any visual representation of this phenomena on screen, so from this point on he just films the actor as normal, shadow and all!! And thus totally blows the whole angle. Either he had zero budget for effects, or he just didn&#39;t care enough to think up any way of showing it. Whatever it was, that should give you a taste of how lame this whole project is. I couldn&#39;t even understand most of the film, and there certainly wasn&#39;t anything on screen worth looking at half the time. Even the ending was as flat as a pancake. A real dud.&#34;

b&#39;&#34;Fool for Love&#34; is one of the several now forgotten films Robert Altman directed throughout the 1980s. This one, a screen adaptation of a Sam Shepard play that features Shepard in the lead role, just simply isn\&#39;t very good. Altman made many not-very-good films over the course of his fascinating career, and many times the fault was his. But here I think the fault lies with Shepard for writing such a flimsy play. Altman\&#39;s direction is assured, the performances are o.k. given what the actors have to work with, but this inconsequential screenplay goes nowhere, and takes its time getting there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shepard is Eddie, a stuntman who has a love/hate relationship with May (Kim Basinger). The two fight endlessly over the course of an evening spent in some dusty motel in the middle of nowhere, while a mysterious man (Harry Dean Stanton) who may be either a figurative or literal father to both Eddie and May quietly observes. Randy Quaid rounds out the four-person cast as a gentleman caller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only dramatic hook in the entire plot is the suggestion that Eddie\&#39;s and May\&#39;s relationship is incestuous. However, this hook feels more like a gimmick than anything. The screenplay doesn\&#39;t explore their relationship in any detail, and it doesn\&#39;t use their relationship to explore any more universal themes. Shepard and Basigner create eccentric, mannered characters who grow irritating within the first five minutes; Stanton and Quaid have little to do but provide reaction shots. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last half hour or so of the film is especially bad, when Eddie\&#39;s and May\&#39;s back stories begin to play out in flashback over monotone, somnolent voice over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Chalk this up to another of Altman\&#39;s experiments gone awry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: C-&#39;

Anyway,even for the low,low standards of both the giant sea animal who kills people-genre and me,this one is just beyond awful.The octopus is one of the lamest,laziest,weakest monsters I&#39;ve ever seen.I think he just ended up in the (ahum)East River because Sea World got sick of him.The actors can be seen repeatedly helping the octopus choking them.Bunch of idiots,that way he&#39;ll never learn!You guys want all the other giant killer octopuses(that&#39;s the correct plural,by the way)to laugh at him?Meanies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up to stop the octopus are wind,razors that are hard to handle and also special sea agent Nick Hartfield and his partner,who will retire in a week but first has to be eaten by the octopus.Hooray,octopus won the fight!A couple more and he&#39;s going to evolve(the scars in my mind stay).Nick of course tries to help him by not doing a damn thing(doesn&#39;t he have a gun or something?)but no,that magically doesn&#39;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay,enter sea cop&#39;s love interest Rachel Starbird.Is this based on some comic book or something?Anyway,together they try to stop the octopus by walking in the park.They hope this helps,cos it&#39;s the 4th of July in a couple of days,and the octopus might join the party.And you don&#39;t know what he&#39;s like when he&#39;s drunk.Rachel then gets a school bus from out of nowhere to make sure this movie won&#39;t end while Nick feeds the octopus some more sea cops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all&#39;s crappy that ends crappy,Nick manages to blow the octopus to bits a couple of times,and a bunch of children who happened to be there cheer and laugh.You know,on tummy-vision,this would probably get an R.In real life,I&#39;d say all ages but I kinda like all ages so my final idea is:Suitable for absolutely nobody.There&#39;s no sex,no gore,no nothing.Now forget this movie ever existed.Join the club.&#34;

b&#39;This piece of garbage belongs in the basement of some moldy old mansion where it will never see the light of day again. The only thing scary about this junk was the price of admission. I was only amused when the ending credits started rolling and I was free to vacate the auditorium. What an unmitigated bore; a complete waste of 1 and a half hours. When I die, I pray I can come back as a ghost and give a fever to the moron who penned this gibberish.&#39;

b&#34;I woke up and it was a beautiful day; the sun was shining, the birds were singing and i fancied getting a movie, something new, a horror movie perhaps? Like many other reviewers i came across what can only be described as a piece of poopy in a gold wrapper. The front cover is great, and the comment on the back is mesmerising - &#39;it will scare the crop out of you&#39;...oh how i chuckle looking back at such naivety and ignorance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the many things scarier than this movie is the acting skills of these &#39;actors&#39;. I think, no, i did actually cheer when they got slashed up by these &#39;scarecrows&#39;, who were wearing some classic fancy dress costumes. I used to drive quite quickly past cornfields as i found them to be pretty scary at night, but having seen this movie, i nearly wet myself (through laughing so much) just at the sight. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen scarier omelette&#39;s quite honestly, not mine though, i&#39;m a dab-hand at cooking omelette&#39;s, and if anyone associates this movie with my omelette&#39;s, let&#39;s just say that i would create a situation in which they would be forced to watch this movie 3 times in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any good corn (crop not pop) movies they can recommend, feel free to inform me. It&#39;s a great comedy if nothing else, OK it is nothing else. Enjoy, but a little advice - before pressing the play button on your DVD player, throw it out of the window.&#34;

b&#34;This third installment in the Scarecrow series is by far the best of the lot. I know, I know...but how good is it? Well, let&#39;s not be silly. It&#39;s still pretty bad, but by comparison to the first two, it&#39;s a fine film. Again shot on digital, with decent lighting and good camera work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****SPOILER****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When a college baseball team hazes new members, one is left in a diabetic coma. Of course, they abandon him in a cornfield, tied to a scarecrow. In keeping with the legend, the boy&#39;s soul is transferred into the body of the scarecrow, which comes to life and wreaks terrible vengeance on, well, pretty much everyone. The co-eds drive to the beach, which is somehow very close to the cornfield. On the sunny beach, they are killed one by one by the whistling scarecrow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writer/director Brian Katkin does a credible job of bringing some much-needed drama to the film. Unfortunately, the drama leaps over good and lands in common cheese. Much of the acting was fair, but there were some really terrible bits, including an awful piece of poorly done lip-synching. Some plot points were left mostly unresolved, and most were used to get someone alone so they could be slaughtered. Again, better than the previous installments, but still lacking.&#34;

b&#39;Please do not blame Korea for this bad movie. I am in Korea (please excuse bad English). It sadden me to see these movies which make Korea look like obsessed with blood and sex. It sadden me even more to see animal killings and hear Americans say that is how Korea is. We do not eat live animals!! So please stop excusing movie for its crime by saying it is the culture! There is scenes with the man eating live animals and non Koreans think it is normal. No it is disgusting to us too. The director is a misfit, sick individual who has obsession with killing and sex with family members. I wish America and France will stop glorifying this bad man who is laughable in his own country. Please watch ANY OTHER movie from Korea, that will give you ideas of how artistic we really are. This movie is rubbish.&#39;

b&#34;This is a really obnoxious show. It is in fact an example of how low television has fallen since &#39;reality&#39; got in style. Tanya is pretty but she is also extremely rude and has awful taste. Is a house show the place for sex appeal? Apparently some males like the show because they find Tanya attractive. The other boss is not pretty but he&#39;s fully as rude and also has awful taste. It is unfortunate that so many houses have to be shown while someone is still living in them. Most of the people who are allegedly viewing these houses before changes are made should be moving into brand new houses or completely empty ones so they will not be insulting anyone. Most of them ..like the &#39;crew&#39;..need to be taught manners. I can imagine how awful the British show is since the British reality shows tend to be even worse when it comes to manners and taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happened to the Arts and Entertainment channel? When it started out (and for some years afterward) it was filled with treats. Now it&#39;s one big trash machine.&#34;

b&#34;I saw this movie with a friend who ran a marathon with me, and we both had the same feeling about it: it wasn&#39;t terribly motivating, and didn&#39;t even broach the idea of what a training schedule would look like, so that non-marathoners could have an idea of what it would take for them to train and run one. In fact there was almost zero technical information at all. I didn&#39;t expect this to be a tech-heavy instructional video, but when that info was near zero then the film just wasn&#39;t balanced, and wasn&#39;t particularly useful to non-marathoners contemplating their first run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were other problems. Some of the very first images were people collapsing near death while trying to run a race. Yeah, real inspiring. The timing was also hard to follow, because it was semi chronological, but the filmmakers rarely gave you any good clues as to what point in time you were looking at. And they withheld information. You see that Kantor has an injury, and you just assume it&#39;s from all her training, but then several scenes later they finally clue you in that it&#39;s because she tripped over a pine cone in her yard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some parts were very good, though, like the bit about a woman defying race officials who wanted the run to be men-only, and the coverage of a Chicago race where two of the runners portrayed earlier were vying for first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Off the top of my head, I&#39;m thinking of other chronological documentaries, like Supersize Me, and Grass, where you always know where you are, and you feel like they told you everything you wanted to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, it wouldn&#39;t have been hard to make a better marathon film, and as it stands I can&#39;t recommend this to non-marathoners to educate and motivate them to try one, because I don&#39;t think it will have that effect.&#34;

b&#39;Ken Russell directed this weird ( Not very ) erotic thriller and if I hadn\&#39;t known that I would have staked my life that the director was Brian DePalma . Absolutely everything about CRIMES OF PASSION screams DePalma , from the gaudy cinematography that is lit a little too brightly , to the domestic storyline that turns into a stalk and slash plot , to even the title this screams &#34; Depalma , DePalma , Depalma &#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately since Brian DePalma is increasingly seen as a poor mans Hitchcock over the years Russell should have tried emulating a style of his own . Sure an erotic thriller in the style of TOMMY or BILLION DOLLAR BRAIN would have been bizarre with a capital B but at least it would have been a unique cinematic experience . Stories about prostitutes living a dangerous double life and being stalked by a religious maniac were an all too common sight in the 1980s video market . Oh and Anthony Perkins plays the same role he played in almost every movie he made in the 1980s . Yawn &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing of any real note to CRIMES OF PASSION is the controversy it caused . I guess the studio were the happiest people to hear this since no publicity is bad publicity , but as for the controversial sex scenes ... What controversial sex scenes ? There aren\&#39;t any and the only controversy I can think of is of China Blue dominating an on duty policeman with a truncheon . Needless to say he didn\&#39;t come quietly HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA&#39;

b&#39;This movie was the biggest piece of garbage I\&#39;ve seen in a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It\&#39;s marketed as as Sci-Fi when in fact it\&#39;s nothing more than a Christian recruiting tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It tells you quite a bit about the state of the Christian church, when they have to resort to deception just to get you to listen to their sales pitch. But then again what do you expect from an organization that would go through such great lengths to help protect such an enormous amount of child molesters in their organization.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Religion is full of nothing but sexual deviants, hypocrites, and war mongers. Let\&#39;s not forget, our bumbling former President actually came out and said that &#34;God told him&#34; to invade Iraq. And nobody questioned if he was hearing voices, or seeing things? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, going of the subject here. No this movie has nothing to do with UFOs whatsoever, it\&#39;s nothing more than a religious production.&#39;

b&#34;What starts off fairly well (and quite disturbing) quickly sinks into an annoying mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dee Snider (of Twisted Sister infamy) apparently penned the screenplay from his own idea, and while the idea of a cyber-stalking pierce freak has potential, they really blow it here on uneven pacing, bad dialogue, and one of the greatest non-endings you&#39;ll ever see. Despite some lifeless performances, the director manages a genuinely creepy first reel. This really looks like it&#39;s going to be a good low-budget effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No such luck. The plot goes all over the map, and Snider&#39;s character relentlessly spits out tiresome psychotic fortune cookie lines that are supposed to pass for meaningful dialogue. Worse, the supporting cast barely registers, and the only halfway believable dialogue comes from a young girl who helps a detective navigate the internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a waste of a great idea. Oh, and there is a new twisted Sister song, if you care.&#34;

b&#34;Dorothy Stratten is the only reason to watch this unfunny sci-fi spoof, and her appearance is a disappointment. Though she has the title role, her screentime is limited, and she only speaks a few lines of dialogue. If you&#39;re not a Stratten fan, pass this one up.&#34;

b&#39;As an avid fan of Christian film, and a person trying to maintain a keen eye for improvements in the realm of Christian film-making, I was excited to get a chance to see this film. I was ready to see something that would make a new mark in quality movies. I was left disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beginning scene is excellent, though a slight rip-off of Leon - The Professional on the angle, it showcases some great cinematography in the early goings... everything after that was pretty much downhill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was barely able to sit through this one, I was tempted multiple times just to shut it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting, while quite possibly sincere, was incredibly awful. But then again, the heart of the problem was the screenplay itself. The dialog was worse than anything I have ever seen, and even my amateurish screenplay &#34;The Awakening&#34; (soon to be an independent film) looked like a Hitchcock-thriller next to this. (Which isn\&#39;t saying much.) The bright side of this film is that it was filmed on Sony\&#39;s brand new High-Definition 900 cameras shooting in 24P. This film and Star Wars: Attack of the Clones were the first movies ever to use these new technology cameras that year. Unfortunately, the camera\&#39;s performance seemed to be wasted with bad lighting, poor angles, and awkward handling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only good feeling I got coming out of watching this movie was how good my rookie indie film is going to look next to it. ; ) 4/10&#39;

b&#34;STMD! is not a terrible movie, but it IS quite forgettable. The lighting is intentionally poor in many scenes and unintentionally poor in all the rest, so you are likely to come out of a viewing with a headache or eye-strain. Special effects are imaginative, but obvious. The gratuitous nudity essential for teen slasher flicks is there, of course, along with the archetypical teenagers, but the whole movie just doesn&#39;t gel. What was needed was some snappier dialogue and more tongue-in-cheek humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t really recommend that you use your time watching this movie. I often give a nod to a movie based on just a scene or two that demonstrates imagination or humor, but these are sadly lacking in this film.&#34;

b&#39;Do not rent this movie. I ended up buying the &#34;previously viewed&#34; tape of this for $4.00. That was close to the price of a rental, so thought, I might as well buy it. I\&#39;m tossing it out after I finish this review. The movie which stars Lowe, is a music video with few lines of dialogue, slow moving shots and poorly done editing. I thought I\&#39;d be seeing a mindless action flick, which is what I wanted to see, I didn\&#39;t even get that. This movie is an exercise in slow moving shots, no script, close-ups, terrible edited, and a poorly developed plot. I can\&#39;t believe that is actually ends with a scene in which they think the audience cares about the characters. By the end of the movie, we still don\&#39;t even really know who they are. Believe the hype, stay away.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;m so glad he wasn&#39;t alive to see this. This movie is a debauchery of his work. I agree with the other commenter-- this movie was a terrible disappointment. I&#39;d give it a zero, but am forced to give it a 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story was weak, and it reminded me of the days when I was a young teenager trying to write a movie, then looking back on it and realizing how horrible it was. Bad actors, family and friends, and someone stupid enough to fund it was how it was made. It&#39;s really amazing how strings can be pulled to get anything done. If this movie was able to make it out to the general public it puts high hopes on other indie film makers who have talent worth a damn who&#39;re struggling! This movie made me laugh, but for all the wrong reasons. By all accounts this was seriously not meant to be a comedy. Scary movie is a better play on a horror genre-- this movie just sucks.&#34;

b&#39;SO THIS IS where Columbia\&#39;s head of their Short Subjects Unit got his Directorial start, eh? Yeah,it\&#39;s none other than Mr. Jules White who is credited (or is it rather, &#34;exposed&#34;) as the Director of this entry into MGM\&#39;s DOGVILLE Series. Given co-credit as co-Director is one Zion Myers; whose name is heretofore unknown to us. Mr. Meyers was, no doubt, the guy who controlled the four-legged thespians and was responsible for training and &#34;acting&#34;. In short, he must have been the Dog Trainer on the set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE TITLE OF this comedy short is no doubt a play on the MGM feature of the same year, THE BIG HOUSE; which starred Chester Morris, Wallace Beery, Robert Montgomery and a stellar cast in support. We must plead ignorance in regards to this title; not having seen it up to this point. (Sorry,Schultz!) But there are many of the doggie gags that relate to what we\&#39;ve read about the movie*; not to mention some particular character specific gags. For example, we observed a canine convict who st-st-stuttered and deduced,correctly, that the bow-wow actor was mimicking character comedian, Roscoe Ates. We later cross-checked with the cast of THE BIG HOUSE and presto, his name is there! (Brilliant deduction, one fit for Holmes &amp; Watson!) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE PRACTICE OF lampooning popular features was already a tried and true practice in the realm of the comedy short. It was one that seemed to draw no objections from the producers and copyright owners of the major films; but rather quite contrarily received heaps of tassive approval. After all, imitation is said to be the sincerest form of flattery; besides, any producer would welcome even some seemingly irreverent parodying.** AS FOR THE movie, itself, we found it to be interesting in a sort of perverse manner. Seeing so many of &#34;Man\&#39;s Best Friends&#34; being so artificially animated into one, long and boring sort of anthropomorphic gag seemed very tiring to we, who make up the audience. I mean just how many pooches were made to bark, needlessly, in order to achieve the illusion of \&#39;talking\&#39;? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHEN IT COMES to pets, or &#34;Animal Companions&#34; as the Politically Correct crowd prefers, we are quite eclectic; favoring not only dogs; but also cats, hamsters and parakeets. We don\&#39;t enjoy seeing any animal exploited in such a non-funny,extended play format.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AS INCREDIBLE AS it may seem, the step that Mr. Jules White made from MGM\&#39;s Shorts to heading up Columbia\&#39;s 2 Reeler production would seem to have been not only a $tep up in the area of finance$; but al$o in the Arti$tic Content. We never thought that being Producer-Director for the likes of such luminaries as the 3 Stooges, Andy Clyde and Hugh Herbert, as well as some who certainly had seen better days, such as Charley Chase, Buster Keaton and Harry Langdon; would be a step up cinematically.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CASE WE haven\&#39;t made our point yet; we\&#39;re officially panning this one. So, view it at your own risk. We warned you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE * We read excellent accounts of both THE BIG HOUSE and the Laurel &amp; Hardy send-up, PARDON US (Hal Roach/MGM, 1931) in both MR. LAUREL &amp; MR. HARDY by John McCabe (1962) and THE FILMS OF LAUREL &amp; HARDY by William K. Everson (1967). Both books have our most enthusiastic endorsement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE ** The Prison Picture became a Genre of its own; all owing a debt to THE BIG HOUSE. In PARDON US, Laurel &amp; Hardy, Hal Roach and its Director did a first class spoof,the first of many; for a Prison comedy became a required theme for so many a screen funny man to come.&#39;

b&#39;A special unit of four police detectives are dispensing justice in their own unique way in 1950s Los Angeles. Nick Nolte plays Max Hoover, the unit\&#39;s lead officer and his partners are played by Michael Madsen, Chazz Palminteri and Chris Penn. Also starring are Melanie Griffith, Jennifer Connelly and John Malkovich among others. Quite an impressive list of names. Unfortunately that is the only thing even remotely impressive about this film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our story begins when young Allison Pond, played by Connelly, turns up dead in a remote area of town currently under development. Our band of four detectives is called in and it is immediately obvious that Nolte\&#39;s Max Hoover is going to be taking a very personal interest in this case. We will soon find out that Allison, in addition to knowing Hoover quite well, was also involved with some rather important military and government types who may have had reason to want her dead. But who exactly was involved and why exactly would they want this seemingly harmless woman dead? Hoover and crew set out to find out. Sounds like an interesting premise but unfortunately it goes nowhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the impressive array of names, the acting here leaves much to be desired. Nolte is overacting, Madsen seems incredibly bored, Palminteri and Malkovich come off as caricatures, Penn has hardly anything to do and Griffith is dull as can be. By far the best performance is Connelly\&#39;s in all too fleeting flashback sequences. The dialogue throughout the film is forced and wooden. The sense of drama you would expect from a mystery of this type is missing altogether. Nothing dramatic really happens. In fact nothing at all seems to happen for the bulk of the picture. Instead we just slog along towards a rather ludicrous and incredibly disappointing climax. When the &#34;mystery&#34; is solved you may find yourself saying, &#34;Oh come on now, is that all there is?&#34; But it gets worse as after the mystery is solved we get a completely ridiculous and utterly unbelievable action sequence. And even then we are made to suffer further as another awful, badly acted, completely unnecessary scene is tacked on at the end. And then mercifully it is over. And not a moment too soon.&#39;

b&#39;OK i gave this a three A three! It deserves only one star no questions asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your going to look at the movie seriously and take it as a legit B-Horror movie than yes it will get one star. But i believe it is apparent within the first minutes of the movie what we are dealing with is a piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this movie me and the buddy i was watching it with could of turned it off and put on something more &#34;Hollywood&#34; but instead we just decided to rip this whole movie apart from start to finish. We laughed so many times it was almost if i was watching a comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is terrible..... The effects and death sequences are so bad.... The Story complete crap.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact they are trying to make a serious horror movie..Priceless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most memorable part for me is when two of the characters are walking in a supposed &#34;dark basement&#34; which is clearly lit, and they pretend to not be able to see bumping into bones hanging from the ceiling bahahahaha just terrible.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want to laugh at how crappy this movie is, along with the fact it was made in 2004 than see this movie....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wait why am i writing so much? no one knows about this movie...i doubt anyone will even read this hahahaha.&#39;

b&#34;It beats me how anyone can rate this film very highly. It is no understatement to call it far fetched. How the guy managed in such a short space of time to construct a wooden maze of underground rooms is quite ridiculous or maybe he was the greatest carpenter since Jesus. The obese sheriff played by Hoyt Axton looked like a refugee from the Jerry Springer show and I found the blonde female lead Jennifer Jason Leigh rather plain. We have an expression here in the U.K. &#39;mutton done up as lamb&#39; which suits her perfectly. It wasn&#39;t all bad however, I enjoyed it immensely when the end credits rolled and &#39;The End&#39; came up was quite brilliant for this hotch potch of a T.V. movie which if it had been a cinematic release would have been put on video and in discount stores in no time at all.&#34;

b&#34;this is one of the more poorly made movies I&#39;ve ever seen. One has to take anything by Truffaut seriously; it&#39;s not just some B-movie cranked out by hacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;evidently Truffaut couldn&#39;t decide whether he was making a noir or a sentimental chick flick. and neither could Deneuve, whose dozen (?) character flip-flops are simply unbelievable -- not even badly acted; just not acted at all. Among other things, how a woman as beautiful as Deneuve could be a person such as Julie/Marion is simply beyond anyone&#39;s ability to suspend disbelief; the role absolutely demands someone not so beautiful. Belmondo&#39;s acting also suffers although imho his character is not quite as unbelievable as Deneuve&#39;s. The clich\xc3\xa9 ending (which I won&#39;t describe) is unfortunately all too appropriate for this complete mistake.&#34;

Of course , he knows how to make money, but I think the main aspect of your opinions is the fact, that German isn&#39;t your native language and you just ignore - or rather don&#39;t notice the bunch of crap which is said in the sentences.

b&#34;Okay wait let me get this street, there are actually some morons on this site who reckon this is one of the better if not the best Halloween sequel. I even read someone saying it was just as good as the original. Pah what nonsense don&#39;t believe them I&#39;ve watched every Halloween and clearly unlike some people knows what makes at the very least a good horror movie and this shower of S is one of the Worst horror movies i have ever seen in my life. Frankly if i was John Carpenter i would sue the person who wrote this either that or go around to his or her place with a hunting rifle. Seriously Halloween sequels in general are nearly all rubbish, two was crap, three was stupid, four is alright, five is well five, H20 alright, Resurrection painful. Yet, in many ways i find this to be the worst of a very bad bunch of sequels. Why? Well let me just embark on some kind of rant not so much a review but a mindless rant on why Halloween 6 the Cure of Michael Myers is one of the most abysmal movies i have seen in a very long time. OK where should i start, ah yes the plot oh boy the plot. Basically the plot is a heaped together mess containing cults, signs of Thor and some other crap. It&#39;s just stupid it really is, the film tries to be flashy and intelligent yet, its heaped together in such a horribly made way. Why does Michael Myers got to have a reason for killing people? Simple enough explanation Micahel likes to kill his relatives that would suffice, but no we have to have a man in black and mysterious cults and signs of Thor and utter crap. God its so bad it made me want to cry it really did, the writers have tried to add to the character of Myers but have actually managed to do the entire opposite. Apart from wearing a mask and a boiler suit &lt; which is a completely different colour by the way, Myers just isn&#39;t the same guy from the original or even two, heck maybe even four. Thats another thing why has Myers become a Jason Voorhes parody? I thought it was meant to be the other way round, yet Myers is so similar to Jason, all he does is endlessly kill people in gory ways. In the original he teased his victims took his time and as a result the whole thing was far more suspenseful. In this he just walks around hacking people to death. I mean in the space of Half an Hour we had equalled the amount of kills in the original it was just ridiculous. Oh and Myers in this seems to have a really big head, i mean its huge and hes put on loads of weight. What else is crap, oh yeah the return of Tommy Jarvis thats pretty bad, in fact all the characters in this film are crap bar Dr Loomis of course. I can&#39;t stand the little kid, i wish he had got it he&#39;s really irritating. Our Heroin is boring and not interesting. And her whole family are a terrible bunch of actors. The mother is rubbish, the brother is bad and the Father i mean was this his first part or something? He was like a cartoon villain for gods sake he was actually more evil than Myers &lt; By the way his death is one of the most abysmal i&#39;ve ever seen i think even Friday the 13th wouldn&#39;t come up with something so entirely laughable. What else is rubbish oh yeah Tommy Jarvis, don&#39;t know the name of the guy but he really can&#39;t act, he tries his best to be serious and all that but i just wanted to laugh at him. I wish he had died in fact if everyone had died it would have been quite good really. There is Dr Loomis a horribly aged and dieing Donald Pleasence by all account. Despite him being on his last legs Pleasance is still the stand out in the brief amount of time he features. Its such a pity that such a corner stone of this franchise had to say farewell in garbage like this. What else is rubbish, oh yeah the bit where the radio DJ gets it. Firstly how the hell did Michael manage to get in that van when five minutes ago he was in his house? Secondly it was just a pointless kill which may boost the body count but is just another peace of nonsense which adds to the drivel that is this film. Its in fact that death which said it all for me in that it was pointless a lot like this film.&#34;

b&#39;I purchased this film on DVD for \xc2\xa34, but it was a waste, the film is very bad. The plot is your average monster film, where it kills a few people, the mayor/chief doesn\&#39;t believe it, and they fight it at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the film quality is very good, and the setting of New York is impressive for a budget film - as opposed to a small coastal town. The acting is reasonable too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the special effects, mainstage in a monster film, are laughable and the addition of a random bus load of kids to the plot half way through just gets weird. The ending is just bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, whenever you have a chance to see this, don\&#39;t - there WILL be something better on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R-T-C &#34;True horror films don\&#39;t have a PG rating&#34;&#39;

b&#34;this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles! The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing. Antonio Sabato is horrible, I mean even worse than normal. How does this guy work? The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films. I love shark movies and this one just disappoints. I&#39;ve seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work. I&#39;d rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story.&#34;

b&#39;Early talkie feature based on a popular stage play. A murder has been committed and a bunch of people hire a medium to conduct a s\xc3\xa9ance to see who the murderer is. While the lights are out there\&#39;s ANOTHER murder...so it\&#39;s someone in that room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What follows is an obvious, dull and creaky murder mystery. Most of the cast overacts to a ridiculous degree. They act like they\&#39;re on stage (where you have to overdo things) and it looks silly on screen. Most embarrassing is Bela Lugosi (two years before &#34;Dracula&#34;) who REALLY overdoes it as a police inspector. Static direction by Tod Browning (who was always overrated) doesn\&#39;t help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Browning and Lugosi completists only. I give it a 3.&#39;

b&#39;OK, here is the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions. However, this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get this straight. The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. They then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working, one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out. Apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year\&#39;s eve. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to take out Fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings). Interestingly, the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles, assault rifles, the whole nine yards. Later on they even bring in a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I\&#39;m not a cop, but I\&#39;m pretty sure you can\&#39;t just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing. And the police helicopter??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm??? Also, no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? I mean seriously, come on. I know this is set in Detroit, but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could live with some of these problems if there weren\&#39;t other glaring issues also. For one, the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The &#34;characters&#34; don\&#39;t relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren\&#39;t particularly interesting. There isn\&#39;t enough interesting action to make this a good action movie, and there isn\&#39;t enough character development/storytelling to make this a passable thriller/drama. The &#34;relationship&#34; between Hawke/Fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh and by the way, the final scene in the wilderness? Uh, I thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of Detroit and suddenly we are in the woods?? The acting isn\&#39;t terrible in this movie, it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious. I really enjoy some of Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy\&#39;s other movies but this one is terrible.&#39;

b&#34;Bela Lugosi as God? Transvestites discussed in a movie in the straight-laced 1950s? By golly, this must be an Ed Wood film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watching this movie, I felt a combination of guilt, pleasure, and nausea all at the same time. The story is about Glen (Ed Wood himself) and his cross-dressing alter-ego Glenda. Somehow, if this movie were made now, I could see Kevin Kline playing Glen/Glenda. Notice how all the cross-dressers&#39; alter egos are versions of their male name (Glen/Glenda, Robert/Roberta, etc.). It attempts to sympathetically portray it as the mental disorder that it is, rather than as a graphic perversion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somehow, Wood manages to sneak in bondage and S&amp;M sequences into his initial story of Glen/Glenda. Along with these racy scenes, Satan himself shows up, obviously having a bad hair day. The dialog and pace are nonexistent, but the film is enjoyable in its context -- the weird world of Ed Wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sterno says put on your favorite lace panties for this one.&#34;

b&#39;It\&#39;s impossible to make a film based on such a book as the &#34;Brothers Karamzov&#34; by F.M. Dostojevsky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Brooks is a great director, but that film is on a very low level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst part of the film was the ending. Well, let\&#39;s think of the book. In the end we have the &#34;guilty&#34; Dimitrij Karamazov. Afterwards they sent him to Siberia. In the end, the famous epilogues of Dostojevsky, the friends and family making a plan to save him. But that\&#39;s it ... a nd now the film takes two steps more and shows us an illusion ending of the escape of Dimitry and Gruschenka(I think). just from the moral point I\&#39;m sure that Dostojevsky would finish the book with an open end because one the one hand he is not guilty(Smerdjakov is the real murderer) and so he have to be a free man. But on the other hand he goes to his father to kill him, so he has decided to commit the crime... that\&#39;s a moral dilemma and so the following point is an open end...well, for real ,it\&#39;s just not full open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William Shatner as Aljoscha Karamazov... I\&#39;m sorry! --&gt; NO!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The others characters playing in a good performance as we have to expect it from such great actors ... In front of course a superb performance of Yul Breynner as Dimitrij. I think that there are not many actors who can play this part in a better way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as I said in the beginning: This book is unadaptable. It never should be film in two hours that\&#39;s impossible. I think that there are some \&#39;longer films, so maybe they could do the right thing... But I just keep the opinion that this book can\&#39;t be adapted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - 3 points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A point for the great director Richard Brooks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A point for a superb performance of Yul Brynner&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally: A point for one of the greatest writers of all time: Dostojevsky&#39;

b&#34;I walked out of the cinema having suffered this film after 30 mins. I left two friends pinned in by a great fat bloke to endure the remainder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As soon as the opening sequence of the film unrolled, I sensed something was wrong and it wasn&#39;t long before I to stop myself from hiding under my seat cringing in embarrassment. I&#39;m not one for walking out of films however bad as they usually have some redeeming feature, but this one suffered from a catalogue of bad directing, bad acting (bar &#39;Bruno&#39; character &amp; the impeccable Jean Rochefort -according to my friends),awful editing (in terms of theme and meaning), terrible soundtrack and image correlation that seemed to make an art out placing the wrong peace of music over the image and scene at the wrong time . The worst crime was its overall insipidness and unbelievability (a result of the aforementioned atrocities). Why was it so awful? I do not want to waste more of my time explaining. I&#39;d say go and see it for yourself but I don&#39;t want to fill the coffers of this project any more than necessary. Oh, the screening did possess one redeeming feature: My friend cambering over the rows of seats in silhouette with his umbrella hooked over his arm as he tried to steady himself -more pathos, tension &amp; entertainment in those few moments than in the 125 mins of this sadly dire effort.&#34;

b&#34;There are movies that are so bad, they&#39;re good. Then there&#39;s movies like Rest Stop that should just never have been made because they are just plain dreadful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad acting, unlikable characters, predictable plot and a supposedly supernatural twist that adds nothing to the story are all key failures. Some half decent special effects are about the only thing worthy of note. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#39;t even bring myself to write a plot outline because all I really want to do here is warn you not to waste your time and money on this movie. Do yourself a favour and don&#39;t even bother with this film at all. It&#39;s 1.5 hours of your life that you will never get back. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1/10&#34;

b&#39;NO WAY ! I hated Granny. First, she is way too tall -of course she is, it is Tom, whoever\&#39;s brother, who\&#39;s playing her- and I hate that thing she does when she brushes her fake silver hair back, but : there are funny parts in this movie. For instance, the fact that every single actor looks V.G. (very German), and also that they think that, even when left alone, they should pretend that that guy (Tom) is their actual &#34;granny&#34; or something. I specially liked -not- that moment where Charlotte leaves and starts walking to the nearest gas station to ask for some help. She suddenly finds herself in the middle of some woods (where were these before? nobody dares explaining) and turns, turns, turns a-r-oun-d like a ballerina, looking at the stars...and...ignoring the fact that GRANNY\&#39;S BEHIND HER, READY TO STRIKE !!! But, anyway, the music wasn\&#39;t so bad, the haircuts were okay and the ending terribly provocative... Mmmmm... wish I had the German version.&#39;

b&#34;This is one of the worst movies I&#39;ve seen in a while. The acting was just soooo bad. Anthonie Kamerling is usually a fairly good actor, but in this film, he sounded like he was reading his text from a piece of paper. Especially his voice over was extremely wooden. Beau van Erven Dorens was completely over the top as frat boy Fraser, although this probably had more to do with the crappy dialogue. &#39;Ik ook van jou&#39; is an adaptation of a book, and it seem like the makers of the film forgot that film dialogue follows different rules than literary dialogue. It all sounded way to bookish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the situations were very badly visualized. Example: somewhere at the beginning of the film there is a scene where a canoe goes over in a rapid. This bit is just too incredible to be true. You see an obviously rather shallow bit of river, with a lot of rocks right beneath the surface (hence the rapid). We hear some suspenseful music to warn us that there&#39;s danger ahead. A canoe with to girls goes over in that rather shallow rapid. Our hero then dives several meters below the surface to rescue one of the girl. Girl swoons in his arms and utters the words &#39;You saved me...&#39; Vomit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It actually was so bad, that it became funny. This is sad, because it really wasn&#39;t intended. At the intermission I overheard some guy behind me say &#39;O god, there&#39;s another part!&#39; My feelings exactly. What scares me is that the end credits of &#39;Ik ook van jou&#39; were in English. Does this mean that it will be released abroad? Just when the Netherlands were starting to get a good reputation after films like &#39;Antonia&#39; (Antonia&#39;s line) and &#39;Karakter&#39; (Character)...&#34;

b&#39;This has got to be one of the weakest plots in a movie I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, that is not all that this movie is lacking.

b&#39;I got this thing off the sci-fi shelf because I remembered seeing the first of the series when I was a kid. I\&#39;d rented the second one and it was a decent &#34;B&#34; sci-fi. This one was out right obnoxious. The &#34;special&#34; effects on the cars looked like something my 4 year old cousin could have done. The two assistant female cyborgs were so terrible that I literally cringed every time they came on the screen. The plot left so much to be desired that it made me sick. I don\&#39;t know what anyone was thinking when they agreed to be a part of this movie but I\&#39;m sure that they\&#39;d have done better to have left it at 2 movies. The movies in this series are going from good to decent to terrible. I only hope that no terrorist groups have access to this movie as it makes an excellent torturing device.&#39;

b&#39;The Dune miniseries opens with a &#34;flashforward&#34; montage of action sequences. The realisation quickly dawns that these are the *best* scenes out of the 265 minute running time, and they\&#39;re not good. Not good at all. Oh dear. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But let us not judge a book by its cover (even though that\&#39;s exactly what we\&#39;re being invited to do). Let\&#39;s give Dune a chance to redeem itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, here\&#39;s the expected watery opening on Caladan. But who\&#39;s this petulant, strangely ugly man? Paul Atreides? *This* is Paul Atreides? This generic plastic puppet? And why does he look so old? What\&#39;s that? The actor\&#39;s only 25? Well, he doesn\&#39;t *look* it, and that\&#39;s way too old anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But at least he has charisma, right? Wrong. Alec Newman is a stumbling, mumbling buffoon. I\&#39;m picturing him being discovered sitting in the dark in a remedial acting class because nobody liked him enough to tell him the class was over, and he\&#39;s just too dumb to realise it. When your Paul Atreides has all the screen prescence of soggy toast, and an acting range from &#34;petulant&#34; to &#34;blank&#34; your production of Dune is doomed from the start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other actors take pity on poor Alec though, and give uniformly insipid and incomprehensible performances so that he doesn\&#39;t look too bad by comparison. At least, I *assume* that is what they are doing. Because I\&#39;m charitable, you see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, they are clearly being given no direction at all. Random gestures, blank or inconsistent deliveries, missing their marks, it\&#39;s all here. This is like a master class in how not to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And sure, there are more elements of the book in this miniseries than there are in the 1984 movie, but there aren\&#39;t twice as many, because of all the. Pauses. To fill. Time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can forgive all this because of the small budget of $20 million, or only $5 million per hour. Nobody could be expected make quality science fiction on that sort of budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except perhaps &#34;Stargate SG-1&#34; which makes do with $1.4 million per 50 minute episode, or &#34;Farscape&#34; at $2 million. And frankly I\&#39;d rather watch four episodes of either of those while being punched in the kidneys, than have to sit though the travesty that is Dune the miniseries again.&#39;

b&#34;This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes, Nicholas Sparks is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in McAdams and Gosling but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Channing Tatum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance, a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act, leaving an awkward and uneven situation, Amanda Seyfried given a great performance only to have Tatum drop the ball and the mood is lost and the scene cant recover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This story deserved to be cast right, but what it got was a pretty boy who cant act. Tatum should stick to what hes good at, movies that are more about his physical ability, albeit horrible, like GI JOE, step up, and Fighting. The less he talks the better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try not to think of me as a jaded hater of Channing Tatum I went in to this movie with an open mind, because I&#39;ve been surprised many a time by the likes of Adam Sandler in Reign over Me. I gave the same chance to Tatum I didn&#39;t view him here as the sum of his past roles, purely just by his performance in this movie, which sadly was a letdown&#34;

b&#39;As an ancient movie fan, I had heard much about the controversial movie CALIGULA assessed ambiguously as one of the most realistic epics by some and as one of the most disgusting porn movies by others. I decided to see it in the entire uncut version to evaluate it myself hoping to find something positive that would make justice to the many accusations towards the film. I sat down in my chair one autumn evening and started to watch. The beginning quotation from the New Testament shocked me a bit and raised the first controversy in me...why to entail a sentence from the Gospel by Mark in the movie about pagan Rome? But the prelude pastoral scene with a young half naked couple (Caligula and Drusilla) running hopelessly through meadows seemed quite sentimental. The music which sounded memorably whilst the credits also provoked me in the positive sense. Yet, the negative feelings raised in me quite soon, particularly at the death of Tiberius. The cruelty seemed very intense and sexuality exaggerated. However, it was not that horrific to the middle. During the second half of the film, I felt as if I watched no historical epic but an extremely disgusting porn. In the end, I said to myself &#34;This is one of the movies that one may really hate&#34; ... I am aware that a movie may be controversial but I had never expected that CALIGULA would go that far in removing all limits of taste. I hate this film due to many reasons, but particularly one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CALIGULA does not serve a purpose of an ancient epic (which it claims to be), but Bob Guccione, the director and the founder of Penthouse pornographic magazine, aims at combining film art with porn. That is, I think, the most serious matter the film may be accused of. Movie is an art that should be reigned by taste, by message, by some feeling of epic grandeur whereas this movie kills all limits of good taste. CALIGULA shows the most bestial side of human being in the most wicked, decadent manner. Some scenes are so disgusting that I don\&#39;t think there are any people whose psyches will not be affected by them. Some say that the Rome under Caligula\&#39;s reign was so brutal. Yes, it is true. Corruption bloomed at that time, various sexual deviances were preferable to Roman citizens. Yet, I do not think that it is right to focus on these deviations so strictly and make it constitute an emphasis of an ancient epic. I believe that it rather proves the bizarre psyches of the producers and their strange tendencies... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HUGE HISTORICAL MISTAKES: The screenplay by Gore Vidal is notorious for inaccuracies. It is noticeable, for instance, with the figure of Proculus (Donato Placido), a historic Roman senator. Yet, the film shows him as a simple soldier on whom Caligula forces his most decadent ways of tortures and rapes. Moreover, Livia was not Proculus wife raped by Caesar on her wedding. What lies behind changing the stories of historical characters into the stories filled with unbelievable vulgarity and violence? Another example of historical travesty is the figure of Caesonia portrayed by Helen Mirren. She is presented as Caligula\&#39;s wife together with Drusilla, his sister. In fact, Caligula married Caesonia long after the death of his sister. The sexual abuse on his new wife in the temple is a hilarious scene with no historical bases. I also hated the moment with the killing machine - a pure imagination of the director that has nothing to do with historical facts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TECHNICAL ASPECT AND CAST: From the technical point of view, the film is nothing special. The cinematography cannot boast to be exceptionally fine and the sets together with costumes are as well nothing outstanding. Yet, the only strong point of the movie are the performances, particularly the one by Malcolm McDowall as Caligula. He does a perfect job in the main role portraying madness and cruelty of the emperor. McDowall raises the value of the film. If everything bothers you in CALIGULA, you may at least admire his performance. I also fancied Helen Mirren as Caesonia and Teresa Ann Savoy as Drusilla (yet the film is based on a gossip by Suetonius that Caligula made love to his sister). Sir John Gielgud as Nerva and Peter O\&#39;Toole as old Tiberius are also memorable. O\&#39;Toole does his finest piece of acting in the Capri Grotto sequence portraying the decadence and the exhaust of the old emperor. Yes, I admit that THE ONLY THING I like about CALIGULA are the performances. Therefore, I don\&#39;t rate the movie 1/10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAME CONTINUITY: The historical inaccuracy of the film also goes in pairs with poor continuity. Let us analyze just the beginning: Caligula comes to Capri Grotto where he sees the awful pleasures of old Tiberius. Then, after about 15 minutes, the action moves to Rome where a black bird near Drusilla and Caligula\&#39;s bed constitutes a bad omen. And immediately the characters are again in Capri where Nerva (John Gielgud) is dying...? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don\&#39;t recommend to see CALIGULA to anyone. If you want to know the story, read Robert Graves\&#39; gorgeous novel I, CLAUDIUS and CLAUDIUS THE GOD or watch Herbert Wise\&#39;s mini series with the magnificent performance by Derek Jacobi. CALIGULA is a sick film the most serious crime of which is the destruction of art. It is, in its most part, a porn movie that should never be called an epic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are movies that are truly artistic and sharpen people\&#39;s taste of beauty,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are movies that are average entertainment; yet they have something to offer,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are movies that show extreme violence; yet they still convey some moral,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;there are, however, movies that show sickness and decadence for their own sake and consequently harm people\&#39;s minds,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CALIGULA unfortunately belongs to the latest group&#39;

b&#34;Although Humphrey Bogart got star billing in King Of The Underworld, I&#39;m willing to bet he didn&#39;t thank Jack Warner for it. In fact this film was one hollow crown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King of the Underworld was supposedly a remake of the Paul Muni film, Dr. Socrates, but given Humphrey Bogart was in the cast, the character is written more like Duke Mantee in The Petrified Forest. He even has an English writer along in the person of James Stephenson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kay Francis and John Eldredge are a pair of married doctors and Eldredge pulls off a tricky bit of surgery on one of Bogart&#39;s henchmen. Bogey&#39;s a man who appreciates good work done on his behalf and gives Eldredge $500.00 and there&#39;s more where that came from if he plays his cards right. Eldredge who has a gambling problem sees a good way to get some undeclared income. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But when he&#39;s killed in a raid on the gang&#39;s hideout, Francis is also thought to be involved by the law and the American Medical Association no matter how much she protests her innocence. It&#39;s no good and she and her aunt Jessie Busley move to a small town to get away from the notoriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course the notoriety and Bogart and an itinerant Leslie Howard like writer in Stephenson all meet up with her again. But Kay is plucky and resourceful to say the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bogart&#39;s character was ridiculous, no wonder the poor guy was screaming for better parts. He&#39;s a gangster who both shoots down people without mercy and gives his henchmen hotfoots just for laughs. He&#39;s concerned about his image and therefore kidnaps writer Stephenson to ghost write his autobiography and of course confesses enough to burn him in all 48 states. And then let&#39;s Kay Francis completely outsmart him, hard to believe he was king of anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely one of the lesser works for either of the stars.&#34;

b&#34;i bought this rental return for $1.99 at hollywood and overpaid. i didn&#39;t expect much, but thought it would be something to fall asleep by at least. i quickly noted the very weak storyline, the gross overacting by everyone (no one talks like that except in cartoons), and the seemingly let&#39;s-make-it-up-as-we-go-along direction. i know that the participants in this mess must be very embarrassed by it, and i feel certain that it did not help any careers. as for this movie buff of 35 years, it has now provided a ready answer for the worst-film-you&#39;ve-ever-seen question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;ve watched hundreds of kung fu movies and I\&#39;ve heard some good thing about this movie, so I decided to give it a try. What I saw was one of the worst displays of movie making I\&#39;ve ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can\&#39;t help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in Hong Kong in this movie. Everyone overacts to the point of stupidity. Even Conan the Barbarian had some civility. This movie just has half-evolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no self-respect. The narrator\&#39;s character should\&#39;ve be killed for sucking so much...she really didn\&#39;t deserve to live til the end. The entire movie was a melodramatic mess, with horrible acting, bad directing and bad action. They should\&#39;ve just rename this movie to \&#39;The Stupid One-Armed Caveman with a Blade&#34; Here\&#39;s a question...why do some director use quick cuts for some action movies? Answer: To can hide the deficiencies of the actors. Nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow. The movie tried so hard to show intensity, but it became almost laughable. Please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kung-fu movies...or any taste in movies.&#39;

b&#34;I just watched this today on TV. It was on ABC&#39;s Sunday Afternoon Movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wasn&#39;t a very good movie, but for a low budget independent film like this, it was okay. There is some suspense in it, but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down. The script is pretty lame, and the plot elements aren&#39;t very realistic, such as the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder. I don&#39;t know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea, but it isn&#39;t very realistic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller, because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good, but unfortunately, they never did. There were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this, and in the end, didn&#39;t prove to be very creative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there is something good about this movie, it is the cast. Every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with. The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie. She is very sexy, and has an incredibly sexy voice. However, if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good, watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles. In that movie, she put her sexy voice to good use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say, this movie isn&#39;t really worth your time, but the actors were good. Unfortunately, they were all wasted on this movie, which is a real shame. This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller, but in the end, it fell flat. If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this, but much better, see The Hitcher. If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie, watch any of their other movies. You can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it.&#34;

b&#39;Describing this film is a difficult task. On the one hand, it\&#39;s an over-the-top vampire spookfest, complete with cobwebs, eerie music, a hypnotic medallion, and of course a coffin with a creaky lid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, this is one of the silliest scripts this side of Edward D. Wood, Jr. Produced by the same people who gave us &#34;The Bloody Vampire,&#34; &#34;Invasion of the Vampires,&#34; and this film\&#39;s predecessor, the modestly-titled &#34;The Vampire,&#34; the movie sticks close to the lack of logic that characterizes the other films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, this film is a sequel to &#34;The Vampire,&#34; which I have not seen. But no matter...it\&#39;s real easy to imagine what happened. Dr. Enrique, played by Abel &#34;The Brainiac&#34; Salazar, is befuddled when the well-intentioned but misguided Dr. Marion brings back the staked body of his vampiric enemy, Count Karol de Lavud (I suppose there is a rule somewhere that all vampires must be Counts of some sort). Dr. Marion complains that all important doctors throughout history have had to resort to some sort of grave robbing in order to advance their medical studies, and he hopes to use the vampire\&#39;s corpse to study such phenomena as the vampire\&#39;s lack of a normal reflection (at which point he holds a mirror up to the vampire and instead of no reflection, we see the vampire\&#39;s skeleton. ???).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enrique is not pleased, and seems determined to pass off the events of the first film as mere fantasy and superstition. &#34;This man was no vampire...I\&#39;ll admit that he liked to drink a little blood, but that\&#39;s all!&#34; he states. Also confusing matters is the fragile Martha, a part-time nurse and part-time showgirl (!) who happens to be Enrique\&#39;s object of affection. Martha narrowly escaped de Lavud\&#39;s clutches in the first film, and apparently Enrique has spent a great deal of time &#34;healing her mind&#34; and getting her to think that everything that she experienced was not real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so if you were the scriptwriter for this film, you would need a way to get someone dumb enough to pull the stake out of the vampire, right? Well, how about the greedy con man who helped Marion steal the coffin? After getting a glimpse de Lavud\&#39;s body, he sets his sights on the expensive-looking brooch that the Count is wearing, and he conveniently returns to steal it when the doctors aren\&#39;t looking. But darn it...he can\&#39;t remove the brooch because of the stake, so...you guessed it. De Lavud is on the loose again, this time with the shady con as his human henchman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so of course the vampire is after Martha again, and meanwhile the doctors are really confused about what they believe. At first they are determined to prove that there is no such thing as a real vampire, then by the end of the film they are trying to get the police to put an all-points bulletin out for &#34;a man who is dead but still alive!&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can probably imagine the rest of the plot from here, but the filmmakers do throw in a few pleasing twists. One of the sets for the movie is a spooky wax museum (is there any other kind in these types of films?), complete with a fully-equipped torture chamber...with REAL torture and execution equipment. The movie has a very keen sense of style, and not just in the campy cobwebs. One effectively creepy sequence has de Lavud chasing a victim down a seemingly endless series of streets and alleyways, following their progress alongside vague buildings with no doors while lighting the scene like a German expressionist nightmare (&#34;The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari&#34; seems to be an influence).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the rest of the film is juvenile, particularly in the film\&#39;s climax. The special effects are quite crude, even for the year that this was made, and the climactic fight with de Lavud in bat form is laughable enough...but the director feels the need to ask us to believe that Martha would faint and collapse directly over top of a guillotine, positioned so that her head was in the perfect location to be chopped off by the blade, which is in danger of falling because the restraining rope has suddenly begun to fray RIGHT AT THAT VERY MINUTE! What an unfortunate coincidence! To make matters worse, he cuts away from the fraying rope to scenes of Enrique trying to dodge the swooping rubber bat, basically standing still and waving his arms around. It\&#39;s definitely an Ed Wood moment if ever there was one, especially when Martha seems to revive on her own and rises groggily to her feet just as the blade slams down. Whew! What a relief! In terms of kookiness, &#34;The Vampire\&#39;s Coffin&#34; does not have the lunacy factor of &#34;The Bloody Vampire&#34; or &#34;Invasion of the Vampires&#34;, but fans of these types of old horror films will appreciate the atmospheric photography, and the fact that the director manages to wring some real chills from this material has to &#34;Count&#34; for something (haw haw).&#39;

b&#39;Good old Jess Franco! The always-reliable choice of director in case you\&#39;re looking for undemanding sleaze, shameless exploitation and 200% gratuitousness. Jess once again really surpassed himself with this utterly trashy piece of jungle &#34;adventure&#34;. Let\&#39;s face it, this film is basically just an excuse to have the ravishingly hot (and underage\xc2\x85) actress Katja Bienert parade around topless. It\&#39;s actually a rather disturbing thought that an innocent 16-year-old girl had to walk around a film set naked in front of a whole crew and particularly before the gazing eyes of pervert Franco! And it wasn\&#39;t even the first time, since the duo previously already made &#34;Linda&#34; together. Anyways, just in case you wondered: YES, &#34;Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro&#34; does have a plot, albeit a very imbecilic one. During the opening sequences a plane, carrying aboard a wealthy Scottish guy and a girl child, crash amidst an African tribe of vegetarian cannibals. I say vegetarian because they never at one point in the film so much even attempt to consume human flesh. The obnoxious Scot declares himself the Great White Leader and the girl grows up to become the beautiful and scarcely dressed White Goddess. Several years later an expedition reaches the middle of the jungle to get the girl back to civilization and \xc2\x96 even more importantly - to steal some of the tribe\&#39;s legendary diamonds. This could have been a compelling and action-packed adventure movie, but Jess Franco obviously couldn\&#39;t be bothered. Why shoot jungle chase sequences or bloody cannibalistic rites when you can just as easily aim your camera at a hot young chick sitting naked in a tree? Most of the jungle settings simply appear to be filmed in someone\&#39;s garden and there\&#39;s a massive amount of clumsily edited National Geographic wildlife footage in order to fill up the gaps in continuity. The back of the DVD describes &#34;Diamonds of the Kilimanjaro&#34; as an ingenious, feminist and adult orientated version of Tarzan. Yeah right, they just put that sentence there because Katja Bienert\&#39;s character swings from one tree to another using a a couple of times.&#39;

b&#39;There were but two reasons for me to see this film. First of all Stellan Skarsgard and Marisa Tomei were in it (who are both good actors) and I had nothing better to do. While seeing the film though, I immediately thought of something better to do: SLEEP! This film is a complete waste of time. It is a standard ex-cop flick. The ex-copper is the best there ever was, but he was fired. He keeps doing stuff on his own to the dislike of his former buddies and he saves the day. All BIG surprises (NOT!!!). Go to sleep, or if you have insomnia, try this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10&#39;

b&#39;I made a big mistake going to see this film. That\&#39;s the lottery of going to see films I guess. After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker, and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat - the old &#34;lose two hours of your life&#34; kind of feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fundamental problem is that, without even mentioning the whole &#34;historical accuracy&#34; thread of reviews, the script is achingly, painful, bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible, real, plot development. Instead, it lurched from from one undramatic &#34;dramatic&#34; event to the next. Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point. And that whole walking off into the sunset through the long-grass field at the end, what the hell was that about? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one. You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter. The most fabulously awful one was, for no apparent reason, he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment, she looks up, it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kind-a lighting (or am I dreaming), and he says, with authority in his voice, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;WASH ME.&#34; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And she gets up and washes him, with a sponge. &#34;Wash me&#34; WTF? That\&#39;s hilarious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there was the music. The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting, waiting, standing there silently for what seems like forever. And then, finally, launching into enormous sound. It was spine-chillingly wonderful and dare I say it, it brought tears to my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So that is where the film picked up two stars. The only part of the film where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I believed him.&#39;

b&#34;When my Mum went down to the video store to rent a film for the night my sister and I learned a lesson, to always company my Mum to the video store! In fact the only reason why she chose it was because Colin Firth was in it and she *cough* thinks he&#39;s a good actor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It starts off with some beautiful veiws of Africa and then goes DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN, AND DOWN. After this film I was very surprised that Colin Firth got as far as he did since this pointless film could destroy any actors career.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is about a divorced women who&#39;s son is trying to matchmake her to a man called Matthew Fields who he met whilst impressing his friends because of his large house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nimi the divorce does not like Matthew at all and is going out with the local vicar who does not like her son John.... and the same with him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sorry if you disagree with me and i hope i haven&#39;t offended you but to all the people who haven&#39;t seen this film, I leave you with one word of warning, DON&#39;T WATCH THIS FILM!!!!!&#34;

b&#39;Not to be confused with Michael Ritchie\&#39;s nasty 1975 beauty pageant spoof, this &#34;Smile&#34; is a down-turned example of those good intentions paving the road to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film parallels two stories: an impoverished Chinese father sacrifices his wife and son to raise a facially-deformed orphan named Ling (Yi Ding), and a TV-spawned Malibu family act out &#34;Gidget Get Birth Control.&#34; Katie (Mika Booram, the third Olsen twin) plays a spoiled, self-absorbed high schooler distanced from reality. Her teacher (Sean Astin) paves the way for a school trip to China aimed at showing students how to work with deformed children.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film uses deformity as a means of suspense by treating Ling like the Frankenstein monster. Kramer continually masks her deformity through hats, hoods and camera placement. This approach exploits the freak show quality inherent in the material. She may be uncomfortable with the way society views her and Kramer\&#39;s answer is to cover her up until the big reveal. Why disturb your audience with such unpleasantness? We see her face briefly at the end and only minutes before closing-credit snapshots of her after surgery disclose a swan beneath the harelip. It is not good enough to give the girl a reason to live; what is imperative is Ling being equally as hot and popular as Katie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funding for the film came from a trust established by the late Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They envisioned a heritage of quality family films. Give me &#34;Son of Paleface&#34; any day.&#39;

b&#34;I just saw this movie. I liked the soundtrack.I saw first the trailer and was magnificent, like all Hollywood movies, they know how to sell.But the movie is almost awful, first 30 minutes are interesting, but then.... like almost all new movies they blow it up. I don&#39;t get the idea, why that kid died??Is a clich\xc3\xa9, every nigga&#39; movie must have a kid to be killed, and everybody must become good after his death.LOL.I don&#39;t understand what is the connection with the movie... And is so predictable, you know the end from the very first minutes.Nothing new in this movie. I saw &#39;You got served&#39; same idea but also... something new... this is something like &#39;Honey&#39;, but is not a little bit difference between them.If you have no other option watch this movie, but be sure is the last option you take.

b&#39;There\&#39;s only 2 reasons I watch this show...I invested the time already in previous episodes and Col Tigh. For all you supposed Sci-Fi fans out there who love the new BSG, give me a break! Go read some classic Sci-Fi novels by the true greats or watch some of the milestone films and TV shows from days gone by and you\&#39;ll see what hacks these BSG writers are. Their only gimmick is &#34;who is the fifth cylon&#34;. Poor writing and really, truly no sense of character development. If Adama resigns or tries to take power or cries again or discovers the inner father he should have been one more time...ahhhhh! And Roslin is as annoying a character that\&#39;s ever been put aboard a starship. Out the airlock with her. I could care less if it\&#39;s six more months before they conclude. These wannabe writers were out of tricks in season one. If you don\&#39;t know that, you just don\&#39;t know writing.&#39;

Natives warning of mass death and destruction if things are not returned back to the way they were? Check. Amateurish CGI special effects that could have been produced by a Commodore 64 computer? Check. Seriously, virtually all the clich\xc3\xa9s of your typical Sci-Fi Original movie have been lumped into a classic, so-bad-it&#39;s-good movie. The only one that&#39;s missing is the scientist/expert trying to impart his knowledge; there is a paleontologist with three students who get ambushed my The Bone Eater fairly early in the movie, but they are basically extras in the movie. And I can honestly say that I predicted virtually all of this; right down to who survives and who doesn&#39;t (though I have to say I got the actual death time of one of the characters wrong by about an hour). I swear I could have done this movie myself if they gave me all the characters. Despite all this, the movie is fun to watch, if for no other reason than to play MST3K with your friends. If you&#39;re up for some mindless fun, it&#39;s a great movie to watch, which is why I give this movie a surprisingly respectable 4, even though for all intents and purposes it deserves a much, much lower rating. But then again you wouldn&#39;t tune in to a SciFi Original movie if you were looking for a movie with an actual plot, substantive characters or good special effects, would you?&#34;

This doesn\&#39;t sit well with Jeff\&#39;s newspaper reporter girlfriend, Kelly (Chelsea Field) who\&#39;s looking for a story on the squad.

The acting is all right for what the actors were given to work with however that\&#39;s no real reason to watch the film. Kinda sad seeing as the six previous Mark L.

b&#39;This screened at Sundance last night to a receptive if mute crowd. Clearly the story is worth relating, it\&#39;s powerful and true, but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face? I mean, really, you spend have your time saying &#34;Oh look, it\&#39;s the guy from \&#39;Armageddon\&#39;&#34;, or &#34;Hey, it\&#39;s Easy Rider!&#34; and you lose sight of the story. Perhaps it\&#39;s the only way this guy could get his movie made, but it\&#39;s a little distracting, sort of like \&#39;The Love Boat&#34;, or those old Towering Inferno movies, that were \&#39;chock o\&#39; block with stars!\&#39;. I wish he\&#39;s just told the story simply with less famous faces. Also, the camera work seems kind of lazy, like there wasn\&#39;t any thought about where to put the camera to best tell the story. All in all, I thought it was okay, but could have been really good.&#39;

b&#39;The show is at least partially Faked (So is not reality, just pretending to be reality), which makes me believe at least anyone without face blurred out is a Fake episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Proof in the episode where he pretends to be stabbed There is already camera crew on the boat, before he gets there, can been seen as his boat approaches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actors playing &#34;ambulance officers&#34; didn\&#39;t remove his shirt or expose the wound in anyway so they work on it, which would never happen in reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also parked the ambulance in the car park and did not drive up to the Emergency entrance (Which does not make any sense, unless its fake and they would not be allowed to go there)&#39;

Is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes, is the horrible \&#39;Russian\&#39; accent of the \&#39;cosmonaut\&#39;, is it the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits, or the &#34;US will save the world&#34; vitriol? No. It\&#39;s the fact that regardless of the &#34;sad&#34; ending - there is very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what\&#39;s going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one good part of this movie: &#34;American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!&#34;&#39;

But I must say I have not expect anything else from Rade Serbedzija,but I have expected more from Vincent Gallo.The film lacks a plot, character,development,denouement.Entire movie is about underground tunnels and how they are mystique.I must be fair there is some camera effect but even that is too poor.Over and over are the same pictures.Total waste of time.&#34;

b&#39;What a waste of great acting talent. This is a shame because with Catherine Deneuve, Mathieu Amalric, Emmanuelle Devos, Chiara Mastroianni, and Melvil Poupaud (not to mention others less well known in America) that\&#39;s a lot of acting talent to waste. This film by Arnaud Desplech was a terrible disappointment. After having enjoyed his &#34;Kings and Queens&#34; and this film left me completely bored and frustrated to the point where I actually left before the movie ended. The movie wandered around its central storyline (involving Catherine Deneuve\&#39;s illness) getting sidetracked by every peripheral storyline and supporting character that appeared on screen. The movie also gave us too little character development to understand why the different characters disliked each other so much (this was a story of family dysfunction) so that the dearth of coherent narrative became even more critical. Finally, the soundtrack (which ranged from hip hop to Bach to Mendelhson\&#39;s Midsummer Night\&#39;s Dream) was at odds with the emotional temperature of the movie and further obscured any emotion the viewer should have been feeling at the time. The photography (the director often began scenes with a mainly dark screen, where our only sight is through a small opening, making feel as if we are watching through a peephole, that then expands) was also pretentious and inscrutable.&#39;

b&#34;I liked some of the characters, but our lead relied too heavily on a charming smile. I didn&#39;t care two whits about him. He makes bad choices and I really didn&#39;t care since he did not seem to either. He seemed rather unintelligent. There were a couple of moments that provided a chance at some human insight (the scene with the whale was interesting), but these are lost in the general malaise of the film. The love interest was acceptable and the other various characters were mildly interesting, but the plot meanders around too much and left me wanting at many points in the film. In the end, I wondered why I stayed so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some tepidly humorous moments, but ultimately I did not care. I cannot fathom rating the film higher. - 3 of 10&#34;

b&#34;I am not so old that I can&#39;t remember laughing at Bobcat Goldthwait a couple times. But some where in all his years of drug abuse he lost his sense of humor as well as his brain cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment this film opens you can have no sympathy nor empathy for the female lead. Neither will you find anything remotely funny after hearing the opening line. Goldthwait obviously hates himself so much that he needs to degrade in order to feel better- even if it is his own imaginary characters he degrades. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you ever saw Shakes the Clown you know how unfunny Bobcat was 15 years ago...this movie is worse. It was not even funny by accident It is sad, pathetic and a total waste of time. May Goldthwaits&#39; hands be rendered paralyzed so he can not write another script. Strike his tongue so he can not dictate another unfunny scene. He is sad and pathetic and needs to make room for a new talent dying to get into Hollywood&#34;

b&#39;is it just me or have all &#34;horror&#34; movies become nothing more than titties, slapstick, and an over the top villain who cannot be killed. this movie had no point. whatever happened to the days of a person being able to escape from the killer as in hostel. and at least make the killer a little more realistic. victor crowley was the worst killer i have ever seen. he reminded me of a demon spawn between quasimodo and leatherface. it was over the top that while victor was lying there on fire no one thought to finish the job. and the ending was the biggest disappointment of all reminiscent of the soprano\&#39;s finale. i had to agree with the fella behind me when he blurted... WHAT THE F***! if i could give the movie a negative score i would have taken care of it.&#39;

b&#39;So bad, it\&#39;s entertaining, especially during cocktail hour, and believe me, you\&#39;ll need a beer, a drink, or whatever to get through this turkey. Where do they get the financial backing for such paint-by-the-numbers &#34;horror&#34; flicks? The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order, and trashing the so-called &#34;uniforms&#34; the &#34;military&#34; jokers wear. The raptors, by the way, are not the same raptors we met in &#34;Jurassic Park,&#34; but a cousin species. (Sorry, no spoilers here. You\&#39;ll have to watch it to find out for yourself) Don\&#39;t expect the plot to make sense, simple as it is, just go along for the ride. You could make it a game... take another drink each time you hear a certain sound... or better yet, every time someone gets crunched by a &#34;raptor.&#34; With a little luck, you won\&#39;t even remember having seen this &#34;C-grade&#34; made-for-TV movie!&#39;

b&#39;This was the most uninteresting horror flick I have seen to date. The premise is glaringly forgotten after about 1 minute. The acting is terrible. The scariest thing about this movie is when the two guys kiss, yuck! What were the film festival judges thinking when they gave this garbage a \&#39;best film\&#39; notation? The only reasons I didn\&#39;t turn this movie off were to see what NOT to do as a filmmaker, and if the paper-thin plot line could really keep going on as is was. I was not disappointed by this latter notion. There wasn\&#39;t even a single bit of nudity or gore to keep the kiddies interested! Also, I thought it was tacky to use about 3 minutes of &#34;Resident Evil 2&#34; in the movie... Was that supposed to be filler? \&#39;cause it was the goriest and most interesting part of the movie.&#39;

b&#34;Gordon goes over the top in typical Full Moon fashion, but that&#39;s to be expected. Combs is surprisingly low-key, keeping his performance at a more realistic level than we are used to seeing. Also gone is the usual Stuart Gordon &#39;tongue-in-cheek&#39; black humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The film is quite effective in showing Combs&#39; break down and his final heroic act to save his wife &amp; daughter. You actually feel sympathy for his character, despite his short-comings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I was more surprised at the nudity and borderline porno sex scene, than I was shocked by the graphic violence &amp; gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not classic Gordon, but certainly something you might enjoy if you&#39;ve seen his more famous films.&#34;

b&#39;Is it possible to give a 0 out of 10 rating? Because this one deserves it. While I\&#39;m not a big fan of Jane Austen\&#39;s books, I sat through this one with two women who are. Well, at least we had a big laugh about how bad this film is. Robert Hardy was the only actor with any charisma in the whole thing, though he overdid it as he usually does (nearly as bad as William Shatner). But that wasn\&#39;t enough to save this stinker from total suckitude. It\&#39;s often hard to separate the girl\&#39;s dream sequences from what is &#34;really&#34; happening, and so many holes are left in the story that you can barely figure out what is going on. Too many loose ends and the ending feels like a &#34;tune in again next week&#34; climax. The lead actress is too ditsy and weird-looking to be a heroine, the leading man is too goofy-looking and effeminate to be a convincing hero and the music sounds like some kind of cheap new-agey pet project of the director\&#39;s hippy daughter (I mean saxophone??? mixed in with some kind of spacey operatic female wailing?). So, in conclusion, I suggest you blow the budget and order a DVD of this one as soon as possible. Especially if you like disappointment.&#39;

b&#39;Maybe the best part of the show is the fact that it creeps up right after Conan O\&#39;Brien and Late Night\&#39;s fans are all of a sudden unsuspectingly watching Carson\&#39;s show. Carson Daly can\&#39;t hold a candle to Leno, Letterman, O\&#39;Brien or any other late night talk show host, and Last Call seems to miss more than hit in this hit and miss genre. The shows only redeeming quality is that it\&#39;s so short. But, I wouldn\&#39;t call it crap. Carson Daly is sincere and doesn\&#39;t hide the fact that his show isn\&#39;t great(that honesty is actually helpful here), while some of Last Call\&#39;s skits and material seem to be stolen, they still find the mark sometimes. Actually, some of Carson\&#39;s montages have been quite entertaining, and the skits occasionally have their moments of decent comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an interviewer, Carson is okay, even with only one guest, not exactly late night material but still above the level attained by a high school AV team. However, he doesn\&#39;t have the quick wit that makes Conan so hilarious. I do not like his musical guests, but that\&#39;s more because I am not a fan of that kind of music so, I\&#39;m not holding it against him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the house band. I don\&#39;t know Joe Firstmans band and wouldn\&#39;t compare them to the CBS Orchestra, the Tonite Show Band with Kevin Eubanks or the Max Weinberg 7. Even Cleeto and the Cleetones are better. But, Firstmans band mates do still the show in my opinion. Especially the Alto Sax player that sometimes shows up (he has long dark hair and sunglasses and is always playing in the upper register), if anything, watch the show for him, I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this show isn\&#39;t even worth a full bag of kibble n\&#39; bits. But it does have an audience, and appeals more to the younger &#34;mtv generation&#34;. If you don\&#39;t have cable and are up at 1:37 am, there really isn\&#39;t much more to choose from and, surprise surprise, there is worse out there in that time frame. So, if you\&#39;re waiting for Poker After Dark to come on, 30 minutes of Last Call wont kill you during the wait.&#39;

b&#34;I normally don&#39;t try and second guess a crime thriller, but Cleaner was just entirely too predictable. Samuel L. Jackson playing the character Tom Cutler, along with his profession created an interesting twist in the beginning of the film, however, that was about it. Without even thinking I knew where the plot would be taken and within 30 minutes I had already figured out who the killer was. Rather then trusting myself and having seen several films that make a turnabout, I watched to its completion. What a disappointment, I was right from the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The casting of characters was a good, as well as the acting from Jackson and Harris...except for Eva Mendes. From the starting gate she didn&#39;t play a believable character in correlation to the script and this ruined the entire plot too soon. Maybe this was a directing mishap or just weakness in the story itself. Her role as Ann Norcut should have shown more emotion and distress for the situation that was building around her. This would&#39;ve made the build-up a bit more compelling and the ending more dramatic. Nevertheless, Cleaner is watchable, not memorable. I&#39;ve seen episodes of CSI that were more thrilling then this.&#34;

b&#34;Maybe it&#39;s just that it was made in 1997, or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS. But really people, the maniacal laughter &amp; mayhem during the withdrawal scene? Did you not see that coming? I&#39;m surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera. The acting was fine, sure. But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language. Things happen, but that&#39;s it. There&#39;s no glue or motive that can be detected on screen, allowing the subject matter to use pre-existing emotional connections to furthur the plot, without the script doing it like it&#39;s supposed to.&#34;

b&#34;Savage Guns (video title) is a dirt cheap, bottom of the barrel spaghetti western in which the survivor of a massacre hunts the bandits who killed his brother and left him for dead, catching up with them in a town controlled by their crooked boss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite plenty of violence, this manages to be both dull and colorless with bad characterizations and almost no imagination or humor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lead actor Robert Woods lives up to his name with a wooden and uncharismatic performance that fails to generate any warmth or sympathy whatsoever. In other words, the viewer never really roots for him despite the fact that he&#39;s the protagonist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst scene (in my opinion) is the annoying dance hall scene where a woman sings in a heavy and terribly unsexy German accent. It was the worst scene in Blazing Saddles and the worst one here!&#34;

b&#39;You know the old saw about a train wreck? The one about how you can\&#39;t look away? This movie isn\&#39;t that good. The only reason you\&#39;re still there is because you brought your kids and you can\&#39;t leave them alone in the theater. You might catch a nap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim Hill should never work in film again after delivering this awful piece of junk. He manages to take a decent comic actor in Jason Lee and turn him into a robotic, unsure actor in this production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn\&#39;t have much hope for this movie in the first place, I admit. If it weren\&#39;t basically the only family film I could take my son to around Christmas, my wife and I wouldn\&#39;t have gone. God, I wish we could go back in time and stop ourselves. I leaned over to my wife about 10 minutes in to tell her what a stinker I thought it was, but she beat me to the punch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m not kidding. It\&#39;s putrid. Only David Cross\&#39;s terrific-as-usual work saves this review from being only 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The story is cloying, insulting and stupid, as might be expected for a movie in this genre (although the recent &#34;Curious George&#34; was blissfully intelligent and enjoyable). The acting is mostly poor. The decision to &#34;update&#34; the Chipmunks songs for today\&#39;s audience was inadvisable at best and boneheaded at worst. It does not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chipmunks of old were clever, mischievous and sly. These chipmunks are dumb, somewhat mean-spirited, obnoxious, and in a surprise, needy to the point of uselessness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either as a retrospect, a tribute, or as a completely new production, this film totally fails. The final straw? My son couldn\&#39;t wait to leave. Spend your money renting Curious George instead.&#39;

b&#39;I\&#39;m just throwing in this review to show that I\&#39;m not crazy -- I like a lot of Wynorski\&#39;s work -- Deathstalker 2, Chopping Mall, Against the Law are fast-paced and highly enjoyable -- just to prove I\&#39;m not blind, I have to mention this, along with some Shannon Tweed &#34;Body Chemistry 3 or 4 or something&#34;, are the lousy ones -- I\&#39;ve got nothing against drawn-out sex sequences, but Julie Strain\&#39;s breasts are so unnatural looking you can\&#39;t help but stare at them - which may be the desired effect but I didn\&#39;t enjoy staring at them -- and several members of this cast seem depressed or disinterested -- The &#34;erotic thriller&#34; was the worst thing to happen to low-budget flicks ever, and thank God that their day has more-or-less done.&#39;

b&#39;I was told Jon was for awhile on spiritual experiences. I guessed the film will be interesting.In fact isn\&#39;t at all. Not so much profound for a such subject. &#34;eternity&#34; never-ending life. Experiences after death and &#34;dejavu&#34;. The film is not as a comedy but isn\&#39;t funny at all, at least not express yet. It\&#39;s so naive. Charming film but naive film. A must to avoid. The Middle ages sequences seems coming directly from fairy tales and it\&#39;s not the matter at all. Eileen Davidson is so charming and Voight is doing his best. Normal is a co producer and screenwriter of this movie. The film was launched straight on video so i discovered it on a video store. It\&#39;s a pity \&#39;cause I well know Voight was seriously involved with spirituality and the film isn\&#39;t so much profound about it.&#39;

b&#39;Skeletons In The Closet takes the father-teenage son genre to new levels of low. This is a movie that serves no purpose. The plot is layed out in the first few minutes, there is no suspense, the characters are clich\xc3\xa9 and despite plot twists that try to confuse and obfuscate, everything plays out exactly as you think it will. Halfway through the movie I could no longer stand the snail pace and started fast forwarding. The movie ended exactly as I expected. Linda Hamilton is great as always and the other actors are above average considering there seems to be a complete lack of direction. If you really believe you need to see this uninspired lackluster wannabe whodunit, watch it on fast forward.&#39;

b&#39;Put the film down and back slowly away. The acting rivals a highschool play, the plot is treadworn, and the production values are slightly higher than community theater. The goofs are so plentiful that it becomes a laugher. Rooms are switched around, the dead move, dogs are used for wolves, men shot point blank with .45 caliber pistols are able to walk and ride snowmobiles, blouses button and unbutton without human touch... this is a baaaaaaaaaddddddd movie. I nearly passed out when I saw the average rating. There is no accounting for taste. BTW, there is no nudity.&#39;

b&#39;I saw Roger Moore huffing it on the scenes that required running or exercise. He was a James Bond who would be most comfortable sitting at a bar telling stories with his fellow British Knights. Nothing against the elderly in age-appropriate roles, but how realistic is it for a frail-looking 58 year old man to be fighting on the wings of planes, hanging off the side of a train, swimming in a swamp with crocodiles, etc.? Aside from the fact that OCTOPUSSY was incredibly silly, vapid, and moronic, the fact that a frail oldster engaged in many death-defying stunts just made it so much easier to laugh at James Bond. By 1983 Roger Moore was clearly looking his age, and he was long past the time when he looked like he could fight with younger men. I saw this movie in the Theater, and the howls of laughter were many and very often. Any credibility that James Bond had built up was gone after OCTOPUSSY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing missing from OCTOPUSSY was Benny Hill and his supporting cast. Another low point was that the incredibly lame Louis Jordan was one half of the Axis of Evil. Jordan helped to make the whole concept even more laughable. And the Russian General was a total goof. OCTOPUSSY works better as a comedy spoof similar to SPIES LIKE US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the fight scene on the train was just a bad copy of the same train scenes done in many other films by better actors. Take EMPEROR OF THE NORTH (1972) where Lee Marvin &amp; Ernest Borgnine fought all over the top &amp; bottom of the train and made it look exciting and real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger Moore had a thin, frail body in 1983 and yet his stunt double was clearly a younger, taller, athletic &amp; muscular man. Even the hair color did not match. This only made his fight scenes more comedic. The Moore stunts looked like those old low-budget Chop-Socky Kung-Fu movies, especially with the bad editing. The Director seemed to try to make the bad acting and bad stunts better by providing several views of the same stunt. This only accentuated the differences between Moore and his stunt double. The fact that the Train scenes with Moore were shot inside a studio could be noticed from the lighting when Moore was in the shot versus the exterior shots of the stunt double on a real train. Though many of the Bond Movies have to be the worst ever when it comes to editing their stunt-fights. You can usually clearly see that the Bond actor is not actually fighting. Overall OCTOPUSSY has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made, and easily the worst of the worst Bond movies.&#39;

b&#34;As a flagship show, Attack of the Show (AOTS) is endemic of the larger fall of G4 TV; it is a show (and a station) that has fallen so far that it parades sex to try and cover its glaring faults. Its predecessor, The Screen Savers, was a venue for troubleshooting technology problems and scouting out the latest and greatest in technology. It was a nice show with a likable staff and it was fun to see some of the modding and other experiments the crew could put to together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acquisition of TechTV by G4 bothered some longtime fans of the station, but early returns were actually promising. The emphasis on gaming was a nice addition and I really enjoyed a lot of the coverage of E3 and other big entertainment events.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, AOTS now stands as but a shell of its former self. Those overseeing the channel have shifted the focus of the channel away from technology and gaming and toward anything that might elicit drool from young adult men. The result is that AOTS spends as much time parading Olivia Munn or touting the adult film industry as it does covering games. It is so bad it is practically unwatchable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While some may get puerile joy out of this sort of thing, those who genuinely enjoy gaming may wonder where the good coverage went. Equally troubling, young gamers who might tune into G4 thinking their getting gaming - that active gaming group between 10-15 - are instead being fed things aimed toward a more mature audience. On a channel like HBO or Cinemax, things like that are expected. On G4, it&#39;s tragic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least SpikeTV, another male-aimed channel, has good programming like CSI. AOTS, and G4, has very little good left to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, really.&#34;

b&#39;I found it hard to care about these characters, who were either annoying or insipid, all living their fabulously hilariously urban lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dialogue was excruiciating at times, and at other times the narrative seemed hard to follow - was it me or were entire scenes deleted?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt like a poor sitcom somehow turned into a film. The stereotypes and jokes about &#34;men\&#39;s groups&#34; would perhaps have been funny in the early 90s. As it is, this is where much of the humour of the film comes from - and boy, does it get old fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the attractive Irish man - this film was a dud. And not even in a &#34;so bad it\&#39;s good way&#34;. The last 20 minutes were particularly painful. Perhaps if you\&#39;ve never met any gay people or never thought about homosexuality before, then this film might have something meaningful to say. Otherwise - darlings, you\&#39;d still be better off renting The Boys in The Band or Beautiful Thing.&#39;

b&#39;Oh yes, I have to agree with the others who describe this as appalling. The acting in this four hour feature is uniformly bad, so bad to the point that I find it impossible to believe any of the actors in this production could possibly earn a living as an actor. I still wonder who did the casting. Each delivers their lines without appearing to have any kind of engagement or emotional investment with any other character. None appear to have a true relationship, family or otherwise, with another. The direction is also appalling and any action scene is laughable and unconvincing. Were the film editors asleep?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The costumes appear authentic to the Regency period but the fabrics look 20th century and colors (especially the blue colors!) are jarring and I don\&#39;t believe were available in early 19th century fabric except perhaps in silk. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the hair: the men have obvious 1970s haircuts, and the women have &#34;big hair&#34;---especially the woman playing Anne Elliot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the female characters, young and old, are quite lovely but this doesn\&#39;t make up for the lack of acting abilities. The actress playing &#34;Anne&#34; looks as though she is in her forties while Anne Elliot is supposed to be 27 years old. I mean, where was the makeup and lighting crew if we were to find the woman playing Anne believable? She spends much of her time gazing pensively with her eyes at the level of the horizon whether indoors or out. I wonder still what that was suppose to convey. Regret perhaps? Yes, this production is regrettable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actress playing Louisa was truly appalling. She screams, squeals, giggles, and leaps around like an ill mannered twelve-year-old (my apologies to anyone twelve years of age reading this) that I found myself eagerly awaiting the moment when she knocks herself out. How this behavior is suppose to attract an adult male is beyond me. Most would back off when she first opened her mouth to giggle and shriek.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actor playing Captain Wentworth portrays someone so bland and colorless one wonders why any woman could pine over him for eight years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rejoining of the pair at the end is not convincingly done or explained. How did they get together again? Not because Louisa was in a coma; that is certain. No, there has to be more than that and it is not explained in the film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this production two stars: one because it is Austens\&#39; work, and the other because some of the outdoor scenes were lovely. The only reason I could watch the entire production is that I was off sick with the flu and I got it from the library. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you enjoyed the book see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds. I would recommend this film even if you have\&#39;t read the book.&#39;

b&#39;I can envision the writers of this story thinking up this script:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.Let\&#39;s make a serial killer movie like Se7en, Knight Moves, Copycat, and Silence of the Lambs. People like serial killer stuff. It\&#39;ll sell... 2.The killer needs to adopt some sort of pattern. I know; he\&#39;ll copy it out of a serial killer mystery novel. That hasn\&#39;t been done yet, at least not exactly like that. 3.Now, we need some kind of way to make this movie unique; of course, the good guy can be bedridden like in Rear Window. 4.Lastly, we need a twist ending that will give this movie the success of The Sixth Sense and The Usual Suspects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, now that you know these things, you know the whole movie, so don\&#39;t waste your money. One thing I really hate about moviemakers is that they take a perfectly good concept for movies and completely run them into the ground. I wrote better stories than this when I was in Junior High. I just kept checking my watch every five minutes. When the twist ending finally came, I wasn\&#39;t shocked, I just said, &#34;Oh. Who cares?!&#34; The characters are two-dimensional. They have your typical movie personalities. This movie is just proof that stealing the elements of other successful movies is no excuse for a bad script. I give this movie 1 out of 10. Normally, it would earn at least 2 or 3, but I\&#39;m so sick of the unoriginality. When will they learn? 1/10&#39;

It is terrible for a number of reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tension&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word - no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again: Under no circumstances watch this film. It is terrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No plot No structure No direction No acting to speak of No visual style No tension&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a word - no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing about it the box and the fact it eventually ends. Who would have thought 85mins could feel so long.&#39;

b&#39;Bobcat Goldthwait should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film, a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything. Melinda Hamilton stars as Amy, a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark. She struggles with telling her fianc\xc3\xa9, John. Of course the truth does rear it\&#39;s shaggy ugly head. The film deals with the fallout of said escapade. The movie is well-acted by all, save for perhaps Jack Plotnick as Dougie, who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture. And the film while solid enough seems to miss it\&#39;s mark a few times. Every single person in the film struggles with massive hypocrisy and all our a tad hard to relate to. Bobcat should be commended for doing something different, as I said before, but different does not always equal good and this pales ever so slightly not to Goldthwaits own directorial debut, the criminally misunderstood &#34;Shakes the Clown&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: C-&#39;

b&#39;I just watched this yesterday and wanted to read other peoples scathing comments but found some high marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHAT??? This was probably the worst Asian horror movie I\&#39;ve seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*spoilers* There were just so many fundamental problems with the story. A lot of Asian horror has the twist of spirits trying to help but just looking scary (with notable exceptions: ringu and Ju-on). This is the case here except they aren\&#39;t scary. A pretty Asian woman who looks a little pale isn\&#39;t scary at all. The &#34;monk&#34; character straight up explains everything as being a perfectly natural cycle of life; nothing scary there either. But the woman just doesn\&#39;t get it, she would rather kill herself and her baby then let this poor ghost be reincarnated. My friend and I were just laughing when she jumped off the building twice and the ghost waits until after the second time to tell her why she\&#39;s been following her around. That information would have been nice to know before she started jumping but whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*That said I did like a couple of parts right in the middle. First she rides a taxi with a ghost (ghosts ride taxis?) that has a whole lot of extra hair which inexplicably IS creepy. Right after that at the bus stop, well you need to see it as it\&#39;s pretty messed up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this movie is a total bomb, I gave it an extra point just for those two scenes above. This is a poor quality Asian horror that manages to make ghosts flying into women\&#39;s wombs almost beautiful while trying to scare you with the same images.&#39;

b&#39;This very loose retelling of Carmen begins on a high note with a smoldering, sexually-frank dance between Senaglese prisoner &#34;Karmen&#34; and her female prison warden, but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film. One minute Karmen is all sexual predator, the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government, and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas... Although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual &#34;Karmen,&#34; the broad strokes it paints are so vignette-like and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic, undisciplined melange of &#34;Basic-Instinct&#34; meets &#34;Bound&#34; meets an African version of a Bollywood musical.&#39;

b&#39;OK I have to admit that I quite enjoyed House of the Dead despite its well documented failings. This however was the worst film I have seen since Demons at the Door. Compared to DATD the effects are vastly superior. However the plot is weak, the acting reminiscent of everyone\&#39;s favourite, the porn film, and the decisions and actions of the &#34;characters&#34; consistently verge on the moronic. I feel like trying out Uwe Boll\&#39;s latest cinematic outings just to get some sense of perspective over HOTD2. I am not suggesting that he is really the cure, more a case of a different disease, but when your senses have been insulted in such an abhorrent manner the only way is up. OK there it is. I have managed the ten line minimum and shall waste no more of our time on the waste of celluloid that is House of the dead 2.&#39;

b&#34;I was kinda looking forward to Man of the Year, a couple girls at my work said it was a pretty good movie, and my mom said that she liked it, so I waited for the rental, and watched it last night. I have to honestly say that this movie was a huge disappointment. I barely made through it, because to be honest the beginning was pretty good and very well paced, but then it got too dark and not into the movie I saw from the trailer. It looked like a good comedy, then it turned into a very dark drama, that wasn&#39;t even that interesting, considering how many of these types of stories we&#39;ve had about government conspiracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tom Dobbs is a very popular comedian with a top ranks show and has an act where many people would want him to get involved with politics, just because it seems like he has a good grip on what should be improved. So he does it, he runs for presidency, but many people doubt that he can win due to the fact that he&#39;s a comedian, but he does win! But Elenore Green who makes sure all the votes are accounted for tries to fix a computer glitch, but when the government tells her not to fix it, they try to get rid of her, and Tom soon realizes that this may not be the job he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting was fine, the direction was OK, it was just the story that didn&#39;t work in my opinion. Like I said, it just turned into a dramatic change of genres, because if you see the trailer, you&#39;d think it was a comedy, and when you start watching it, that&#39;s what you get, but then it just turns into a very dark and somewhat scary drama. I wouldn&#39;t really recommend this movie, it was one of the biggest disappointments I have seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2/10&#34;

b&#39;In &amp; Out made me want to vomit. I have never seen such a shameless film! It seriously wanted to say that being gay is something wonderful and joyous, but has no idea how to say it. To me this was not a comedy, unless cruel,sick jokes are something to laugh at when a victim falls for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; From what I saw, this film had four (4) major flaws starting with (A) Matt Dillion\&#39;s character as he announces to the world that is former teacher, Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline) is gay. Never mind how unbelievable it is that Matt Dillion character won an Oscar for what looked like a serious role on the edge of a crack-up. But why would he say such a thing? After all, this was never an issue with Howard\&#39;s students, his friends, family, nor his finace. Nobody. So why would he say something like it when it wasn\&#39;t true? More to the point, why doesn\&#39;t the movie supply us with an answer as to why he said it? The reason is because there is NO answer, and for the convenience of the plot none is provided. The second (B) flaw is with the fact the film seems to have forgotten what homosexuality is--the attraction and sexual relation to members of the same sex. In this movie, being gay is based on liking Barbara Streisand musicals and being passionate about literature. It\&#39;s all based on stereotypes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both of these flaws are met up again at that must-be-seen-to-be-believed graduation ceremony. Matt Dillion finds out about the commotion going on in that small town and the film looks poised to let us know what made him say such a thing. When he arrives to the ceremony, he says nothing, and I wondered why in the world he then came there at all. He didn\&#39;t solve anything. Then when all of the audience stood to announce they were gay, I was so moved I wanted to throw up! Those folks were standing up in defense of Howard being gay by mocking all of those stereotypes. What the film forgot is that it was using those stereotypes to show why Howard was gay. They filmmakers just shot themselves in the foot! But wait there\&#39;s more!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the ceremony,(C) Howard appeared to be on trial to lose is job as a teacher, because people believed that he would influence his students to be gay. What the film was trying to say is that homosexuals NEVER recruit, and that he wouldn\&#39;t influence his students. But did we not see Tom Selleck\&#39;s character endlessly pressure Howard over and over again, even to the point of kissing him unexpectedly, to come out of the closet when, in my mind, there was no closet to come out of? From that, the film clearly show that homosexual are capable of recruiting. The film, again, then shoots itself in the foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And (D) when Howard came out of the closet, did anyone not notice how the screenplay shut him up for the rest of the film? I counted only three lines he had afterwards: &#34;Yup!&#34; to his parents, &#34;Hi there!&#34; to a student, and &#34;Are you ready?&#34; to Tom Selleck before the last vomitous scene. I might be low by one, but the point is he is not allowed to tell us what made him decide he was gay. I wanted to know what was in his head, because I never for once believed he was gay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As bonuses, the movie also includes several truly offensive scenes. One in which Howard is asking a priest in confession for advice about what to do for a friend (him), who is engaged and has not yet had sex with his fiance. &#34;Does that make him gay?&#34; he asks. The priest responsed &#34;Oh yes, he\&#39;s definitely gay&#34;. Uh-huh. Or what about the scene when all the old ladies are gathered around telling Howard\&#39;s mother that she doesn\&#39;t need to be sad about her son\&#39;s deep, dark secret because, well...everyone has them. Then one the ladies confessed that she\&#39;s never seen &#34;The Bridges of Madison County&#34;. Funny? No! Becuase the film shows that it is insensitive and has no idea how devestating it can be to family to have one of its members announced that he/she is gay. I know. I have several friends that are gay, and none of their families took it well at all. That was a poor way to diffuse the whole situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last straw for me was the last scene that gave they appearence that Tom and Kevin were getting married. The camera panned down very slowly to the front of the church when... It wasn\&#39;t what you thought! I had been thoroughly disgusted by that point, and I never could forgive that sick joke. I have nothing against films about being gay or homosexuality. &#34;Philadelphia&#34; and &#34;Longtime Companion&#34; were very honest and true in what they had to say. &#34;In &amp; Out&#34; is just screaming for political correctness, but has no idea of the corruption at its core. what I gathered from the film is that if you are 99% straight and 1% gay, meaning if you have the slightless doubt, YOU ARE DEFINITELY GAY. It\&#39;s like gayness is becoming a dominant trait in genetics. In reality if everyone told you over and over that you were worthless and stupid, you would eventually believe it too, wouldn\&#39;t you? This is what happened to Howard Brackett about being gay. I left the theater sad and angry. Angry the whole weekend, in fact. This was a seriously sick and cruel film, the WORST of 1997.&#39;

b&#39;Best around the middle, when most characters get horny and go after someone they haven\&#39;t had before. It is around this point that we get to see Susan Sarandon\&#39;s majestic breasts (even if through a veil). Strangely enough, Beverly D\&#39;Angelo who isn\&#39;t shy about nudity doesn\&#39;t show any at all, while Aida Turturro \xc2\x96 of all people \xc2\x96 does. On the other end of the spectrum, the less said about Walken playing a homosexual the better. The film itself has little plot; the dialogs from the theater play and the &#34;normal&#34; dialogs cross over often and that\&#39;s not the sort of thing I\&#39;d consider a good idea. Life in the theater: who cares? Occasionally the dialog has something going for it, but the film drags in stretches.&#39;

b&#39;After the opening credits over a black sheet of paper with spots of white paint sprayed onto it, oh OK I\&#39;ll be generous and call it a star field, we witness an alien spacecraft crashing into a meteorite and being forced to land on earth. A terrible looking model spacecraft lands on a terrible looking model field. Three nearby campers investigate. From the burning spacecraft a reptile like looking alien, the \&#39;Nightbeast\&#39; emerges, OK so I lied it\&#39;s a guy in a dodgy rubber monster mask and silver spacesuit. The campers are quickly killed by the Nighbeast\&#39;s laser gun which shoots awful special effects at people. The towns Sheriff Jack Cinder (Tom Griffith) is informed. He alerts his deputy Lisa Kent (Karin Kardian) and gathers a posse of men together to investigate. Meanwhile the Nightbeast has killed an unlucky motorist who stopped on the side of the road for a leak. His two annoying kids run for help. They approach a house, inside two young people are kissing, the girl says &#34;someones running towards the house&#34;. The guy gets up to take a look and is attacked and gutted by the Nightbeast, it kills the girl as well. Then it manages to kill the two kids with his laser, maybe the Nightbeast ain\&#39;t so bad after all. Once the Sheriff and his men arrive at the scene they have a gun/laser battle with the Nightbeast. After possibly the most unexciting gun fight in film history only the Sheriff, his deputy and a local man Jamie Lambert (Jamie Zemarel) survive. But the Nightbeast is still alive, bullets seem to have no effect on it. The next day the Sheriff visits the towns Mayor, Bert Wicker (Richard Dyszel) and his girlfriend Mary Jane (Eleanor Herman) to get permission to evacuate everyone in the town. He refuses saying a party he is holding for the Governor (Richard Ruxton) cannot be cancelled, and that he doesn\&#39;t want to create a panic situation. The Sheriff evacuates the town anyway. Two doctors, Steven Price (George Stover) and Ruth Sherman (Anne Firth) are attacked by the Nightbeast before they can leave. However, they manage to scare the Nightbeast away and survive. Together with the Sheriff his deputy and Jamie they decide to stay behind and fight the alien. Written and directed by Don Dohler this has to be an amateur film, made with family and friends, look at the credits and see how many Dohler\&#39;s are involved. For that reason I should probably cut it some slack but that still doesn\&#39;t stop it, or excuse it from being a throughly awful film in every department. It has no story or purpose, things just happen to waste time, whats with Drago (Don Leifert) strangling his ex girlfriend Suzie (Monica Neff)? This and many more scenes add nothing to the film. The script has no logic either, why does the Nightbeast stick around the town once it\&#39;s been supposedly evacuated? The special effects are embarrassingly bad, just look at the effect when the Nightbeast shoots someone with his laser, a computer effect an 80\&#39;s spectrum would be ashamed of. There\&#39;s not really much blood or gore in it, a ripped open stomach, a severed arm and a decapitation but they all look predictably poor. Credit where it\&#39;s due, the Nightbeast itself looks alright for the most part. There\&#39;s a sex scene between the Sheriff and his deputy which has to be seen to be believed, music that even a porno would be embarrassed about and two really ugly naked people make this a difficult sequence to watch. Less than stellar acting, photography, music, lighting and editing make it a real chore to sit through. And the worse thing about this film? It commits the mortal sin of being boring and not fun in the slightest. Sorry Don mate, but don\&#39;t give up the day job! Definitely one to avoid.&#39;

b&#34;i stopped this movie at 48 minutes and change... i don&#39;t know...maybe it&#39;s because i&#39;m not Swedish...or french(the cannes commenter)...or any of those OTHER sleepy places from which the previous reviewers held forth... born and raised in NY. lived near san francisco for a quarter of a century. and now Holland. i love a good independent film as much as the next movie enthusiast... but this, in a word, isn&#39;t funny. see? now THAT&#39;s funny...that you&#39;re thinking that i made a mistake. i said, &#39;in a word&#39; but then said, &#39;isn&#39;t funny&#39;... nope. no mistake. if this is your type of humor, i&#39;d say you haven&#39;t really had much of a life... consider your appreciation of this film a symptom... and PLEASE don&#39;t EVER write another review...i have a tendency to believe them when they&#39;re unanimous. even if there only were about 3 reviews before mine...i figured i might ACtually be able to save someone ELSE the boredom...the anticipation of laughter that never materializes... i DID smile once or twice, though... when i started the movie...and when i stopped it. that should be 10 lines.&#34;

b&#39;Okay, you have:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Penelope Keith as Miss Herringbone-Tweed, B.B.E. (Backbone of England.) She\&#39;s killed off in the first scene - that\&#39;s right, folks; this show has no backbone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peter O\&#39;Toole as Ol\&#39; Colonel Cricket from The First War and now the emblazered Lord of the Manor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joanna Lumley as the ensweatered Lady of the Manor, 20 years younger than the colonel and 20 years past her own prime but still glamourous (Brit spelling, not mine) enough to have a toy-boy on the side. It\&#39;s alright, they have Col. Cricket\&#39;s full knowledge and consent (they guy even comes \&#39;round for Christmas!) Still, she\&#39;s considerate of the colonel enough to have said toy-boy her own age (what a gal!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David McCallum as said toy-boy, equally as pointlessly glamourous as his squeeze. Pilcher couldn\&#39;t come up with any cover for him within the story, so she gave him a hush-hush job at the Circus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and finally:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Susan Hampshire as Miss Polonia Teacups, Venerable Headmistress of the Venerable Girls\&#39; Boarding-School, serving tea in her office with a dash of deep, poignant advice for life in the outside world just before graduation. Her best bit of advice: &#34;I\&#39;ve only been to Nancherrow (the local Stately Home of England) once. I thought it was very beautiful but, somehow, not part of the real world.&#34; Well, we can\&#39;t say they didn\&#39;t warn us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, Susan - time was, your character would have been running the whole show. They don\&#39;t write \&#39;em like that any more. Our loss, not yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So - with a cast and setting like this, you have the re-makings of &#34;Brideshead Revisited,&#34; right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wrong! They took these 1-dimensional supporting roles because they paid so well. After all, acting is one of the oldest temp-jobs there is (YOU name another!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First warning sign: lots and lots of backlighting. They get around it by shooting outdoors - &#34;hey, it\&#39;s just the sunlight!&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second warning sign: Leading Lady cries a lot. When not crying, her eyes are moist. That\&#39;s the law of romance novels: Leading Lady is &#34;dewy-eyed.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henceforth, Leading Lady shall be known as L.L.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third warning sign: L.L. actually has stars in her eyes when she\&#39;s in love. Still, I\&#39;ll give Emily Mortimer an award just for having to act with that spotlight in her eyes (I wonder . did they use contacts?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lastly, fourth warning sign: no on-screen female character is &#34;Mrs.&#34; She\&#39;s either &#34;Miss&#34; or &#34;Lady.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When all was said and done, I still couldn\&#39;t tell you who was pursuing whom and why. I couldn\&#39;t even tell you what was said and done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up: they all live through World War II without anything happening to them at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, at the end, L.L. finds she\&#39;s lost her parents to the Japanese prison camps and baby sis comes home catatonic. Meanwhile (there\&#39;s always a &#34;meanwhile,&#34;) some young guy L.L. had a crush on (when, I don\&#39;t know) comes home from some wartime tough spot and is found living on the street by Lady of the Manor (must be some street if SHE\&#39;s going to find him there.) Both war casualties are whisked away to recover at Nancherrow (SOMEBODY has to be &#34;whisked away&#34; SOMEWHERE in these romance stories!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great drama.&#39;

b&#34;weird.this is a TV movie,yet the rating on the box says it&#39;s rated R.there&#39;s nothing in the movie that would remotely qualify for an R rating.aside from that,though,the movie is very slow and pointless.i mean the idea was good,but nothing was done with the storyline.it just wasn&#39;t developed.it&#39;s mildly creepy,and the acting is actually quite good,better than the movie deserves.i don&#39;t see myself watching it again anytime soon,if ever.there have been other movies dealing with the same concept which are better made than this one.i haven&#39;t seen too many Wes Craven Films,so i can&#39;t really compare it to any of his others.as for this movie itself though,i think it is poorly conceived and poorly executed.for me,i can&#39;t give Chiller a higher rating than 3/10&#34;

b&#34;I share the same opinion regarding Underworld as the previous comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sat through the 1.5 hours of this movie wondering what this story was all about and more importantly why the author and/or director had made certain decisions for the plot. On the whole I found the movie to be unbalanced, consisting of strange sub-plots which (IMHO) actually had nothing to do with the movie. Furthermore, when writing a thriller I&#39;d say you want your viewers to wonder about the story and not about the way the story is filmed...&#34;

b&#39;Rarely will anyone deny that Hitchcock remains one of the most creative, inventive and prolific directors of all time, because he is arguably all of these things. It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties. Saboteur, however, is not creative or prolific at all. Rather, Hitchcock set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster &#34;American Pride,&#34; a certain call-to-arms, support-our-troops title which was a popular theme of the time. With that in mind, Hitchcock severely underplayed other important aspects of the film, including but not limited to a logical plot, characterization, believable dialog, and a fluent, running storyline. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically Hitchcock does great with espionage films, only a few years earlier achieving cinematic greatness with The Foreign Corespondant and The 39 Steps, but seemingly lost his stride in creating Saboteur and merely recycled the same once-thrilling story lines both his previous excursions readily provided. Without going into any great depth here is a list of a few of this films major problems: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Despite having his face plastered on every newspaper across America, the only person who recognizes Kane is blind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. At the dinner party, Kane and Patricia don\&#39;t want to run for the door because the bad guys might grab them and tell the party they were &#34;gate crashers.&#34; Logically, what prevents the spies from grabbing them and saying this at any point during the evening? Besides, does anyone need to be reminded Kane is a wanted terrorist?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Since when can a fan belt cut through handcuffs? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Nobody recognizes him...his face is on EVERY NEWSPAPER!!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The spies catch up with Kane in the ghost town and assume he\&#39;s the man Freeman sent to work with them...shouldn\&#39;t\&#39;t he have some sort of credentials? I know spies don\&#39;t run around with name tags and photo IDs but a secret handshake maybe? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Cop picks up Kane escaping from Freeman\&#39;s house, still seems no one recognizes this guy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. How exactly does the FBI come to believe Kane with no evidence? They don\&#39;t even show Kane talking to the FBI, the scene simply fades in and we are forced to assume everything is now kosher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8. When the cops search the Carnival Caravan how do they know Kane is now with a woman? The blind man believed Kane\&#39;s story thus logically would not have reported his daughter missing, kidnapped, or even more importantly running with Kane. Why does this movie not employ logic?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a running list. The movie is not exciting, the plot makes no sense, and the world is full of people who willingly take wanted terrorists into their homes and cars everyday because its no big thing. Hitchcock fails miserably on this one.&#39;

b&#34;First of all, I wasn&#39;t sure who this film was aimed at - it seemed like a story for kids but had stuff in it kids wouldn&#39;t understand and find boring. There wasn&#39;t really much to it, Bruce Willis wasn&#39;t stretched as an actor at all. He did a lot of glancing to the side with that half smile of his - unless you are a big fan of his I wouldn&#39;t bother. And if it&#39;s the story you&#39;re interested in (guy who seems to have it all but is lacking emotionally is taught lessons from a child), I would go to see About A Boy. It has everything this film lacked, humor, sadness and reality.&#34;

b&#39;When a group of dumb kids (including an unlikable. racist bitch) stay at an old house, it awakens four murderous Toltec spirits. Can Lash La Rue save the day? Will you be able to watch until the end due to the horrible comedy on display.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#34;The Dark Power&#34; is the kind of really bad horror/comedy hybrid Troma used to release regularly. Thing is, they didn\&#39;t. release this. That doesn\&#39;t excuse the whole thing, as it has a dreadful synthesizer score (including bad attempts at Native American music and even worse &#34;comedy&#34; music), bad make up effects (basically Halloween masks), and atrocious acting (Ok, the fat guy was alright, though everyone else is terrible, and La Rue, a Western movie vet, seems embarrassed to be there-not that I blame him really.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worst thing though, is the comedy aspects. Sure, dumb teens is one thing, but when the movie keeps talking about the Toltec spirits as if they are the ultimate evil, only for them to turn out to be horribly annoying, bumbling fools, all hope is dashed. Combining horror and comedy takes at least some skill. There is no skill on display here, as it all is just stupid, and not &#34;so dumb it\&#39;s fun&#34; either. I mean &#34;smoking pot and listening to bad Punk Rock aren\&#39;t I dumb&#34; dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not even a decent ripped off face and a chick in little clothing can save this disaster. Terrible movie, and not even worth a rental.&#39;

b&#39;technically, this movie would have had it all: decent actors, a nice landscape, no obvious sights of a lack of budget, a celebrity like richard attenborough. the plot summary also sounded promising, suggesting a satire on silly bureaucracy and common people outwitting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, it never delivers. the plot is simply too illogical. throughout the whole movie, not one person does a single sensible thing. mad politicians, ridiculous soldiers, brain-dead villagers - all just hustle from one incredible situation to the next. what they all do never makes sense in a context beyond the current scene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;of course, this kind of movie has to be absurd and exaggerated. however, it\&#39;s also supposed to have at least one instance to point out the madness behind splitting a city in the middle. actually, there are (at least) two attempts, which unfortunately fail: the main character, who doesn\&#39;t seem to have a clue about what\&#39;s happening to him, and the &#34;writer&#34;, who occasionally cracks jokes from the off that might be considered funny by an audience consisting solely of 12 year olds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;what i found most impressing is that the movie tries to be funny all the time, but didn\&#39;t made me laugh once. i\&#39;ve seen several bad &#34;funny&#34; movies, but until yet every single one of them featured at least 2 or 3 good laughs. so in this sense, &#34;puckoon&#34; is really remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you want to see a great movie with a comparable plot, check out &#34;brazil&#34;. don\&#39;t waste your time on &#34;puckoon&#34;.&#39;

b&#39;As a total movie geek with the fortunate job of video store manager, I tend to watch all sorts of movies, from good to very very bad. This was a movie with so many corn-ball lines, cheesy CGI effects and predictable plot points that I ended up laughing extensively before switching it off after 30-40 minutes. The &#34;creature feature&#34; genre of movies has been putting out some pretty awful stuff in recent years (Godzilla 2000 anyone?), but this movie makes me think the creators weren\&#39;t even trying. It might be worth checking out just for the &#34;make fun of me&#34; potential (count the gunshots!), but I couldn\&#39;t in good conscience recommend this movie to anyone.&#39;

b&#34;I&#39;m rather surprised that anybody found this film touching or moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The basic premise of the film sounded to me like an excellent, if provocative, idea for a movie about a rare sort of relationship, but one (if I can judge by the real-life examples I&#39;ve known) is extremely deep and loving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the film is cheaply scripted--poorly scripted--and although it has a number of very pretty-looking shots, I didn&#39;t find it to be anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably the biggest problem is that it is far too short and poorly-composed to give its audience time enough to invest, emotionally, in the characters: we don&#39;t really care about any of them, and so their stresses and obstacles don&#39;t really touch us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think a REMAKE--from the screenplay up--with some character development by some really good writers--could improve it greatly. It is instructive to compare this film with Brokeback Mountain, which the screen-writers took to far loftier levels than did the author of the screenplay--screen-writers who were clearly conscious of how to write a classical tragedy, and carried out their task with care, planning, and superb craftsmanship! However, people only seem to remake those films that don&#39;t need it! You&#39;re not really missing anything if you skip this one: I found it very disappointing indeed, and it is only saved from getting a 1-star from me by virtue of the daring and gumption it took to make a film on this sensitive subject.&#34;

b&#34;How on earth were these guys given funds to make this movie? The lack of script is one thing, but the cinematography makes you want to weep. A hand held camera can be of great value to the look and feel of a movie but in that case you need a photographer who knows what he is doing. I am well aware that the actors are amateurs but it&#39;s of no defence since the director might be the least talented one ever directing in Sweden. It would be a shame for the industry if he (or any in the team for that matter) is given money to make a film ever again. This movie simply provides fuel to the argument that too many movies are made in Sweden each year.&#34;

b&#39;I found myself getting increasingly angry as this movie progressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, Dr. Crawford (Dennis Hopper) has predicted a meteor will hit the earth. The &#34;powers that be&#34; don\&#39;t believe him so he sets about building a survival shelter inside a mountain for a small collection of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jake Lowe (Peter Onorati) is a down on his luck reporter for a trashy tabloid who gets a tip from a friend he thought was dead that something is going on in the mountains. He sets out to investigate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While trying to get into the secret survival shelter Jake spends a great deal of time shooting people to death or beating them to within an inch of their lives. He spends the rest of his time bitching at Dr. Crawford about who gave the doc the right to decide which people should get to survive the meteor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found myself wishing Jake would do the future a big favor and turn a gun on himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time on this turkey.&#39;

Acting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ugh, I guess I got what I wanted in that Dominique was ok, but man, the rest of the cast besides maybe Brad Renfro were bad or at least not interesting or likable at all. I know some could say that the others were good because they made me hate them....trust me....I like unlikable chars but this group is unlikable because they can\&#39;t convincingly be bad people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It figures that the only other people I got this for were barely even in it and that is Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips, but the little time they had they were ok. Melanie spoke maybe 2 lines, but at least Bijou had a good character although small.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Violence and Gore&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My mind was constantly under attack from horrid dialogue and very very annoying characters, that\&#39;s violence enough!! ok there was one bludgeoning with a rock which was ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T&amp;A Nudity Factor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hahaha, they couldn\&#39;t even add in any nudity to help spice up this movie, probably because no one would want to bear their body for this crap. If they are going to expose themselves they should do it in a movie where they will be remembered as their character and not for &#34;oh hey I heard she gets naked in this one.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall View of the movie (review)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ok ok I know I pride myself on being the person who can like most if not almost all movies or at least find some good in it. Well this movie is one of the few I really struggled to find anything worth while in. The problem with this movie is that it is so damn annoying. I already have a deep hatred for snobby rich people attitudes and that didn\&#39;t help either. All this movie really is, is just a bunch of rich people sitting around acting depressed and stupid. I can\&#39;t stress the annoyance factor enough. This movie tries to rehash the tried and true &#34;In group&#34; plotline which can usually be done ok with little difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I not have a pic from the movie or the box cover? Well I felt this movie didn\&#39;t deserve that glory so I decided to put a pic of the reason I rented this, and that reason is none other than Dominique Swain. Yes I too was wooed by her in Lolita and thought she was so good that I decided from then on to check her out in any movie in which she acts. At least I keep my promises and yes I have seen the majority of her movies, minus a few hard to find ones. She herself is a great actress and I would defend her actively, but man she chooses some of the crappiest movies to star in. This movie and Smokers are both in the same boat of crappiness, but at least Smokers had a cool idea for a story and even some real good scenes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the dvd box tries to fool you into thinking that this movie has stars as well in it by putting Melanie Griffith and Bijou Phillips names on the front of the box. If there\&#39;s one thing that P****S me off it\&#39;s a movie that plasters the names of stars on a box to make you think &#34;wow it has ____ I wonder how good ___is in this one I saw ___ in that movie and thought she was great!&#34; only to have the big names in the movie for a total of maybe 10 minutes between the 2. Bijou actually had a part that semi-meant something. Melanie on the other hand, only has 2 lines about.... Granted I don\&#39;t like Melanie that much, but this is about ethics and not star acting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Out of all this mess though props must go to Brad Renfro for turning in an ok performance along with Dominique. Brad may be one very messed up kid in real life, but at least he can act. So the only reason this movie gets any skulls is because I got what I basically wanted which was Dominique Swain and Brad Renfro. Also I had the added pleasure of seeing underrated actress Bijou Phillips make me like her even more. So even though I was annoyed throughout I still came out with some positives, although this was pretty hard this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend you to ONLY see this if you\&#39;ve seen Lolita and know how good Dominique is or if you are some offbeat fan of Brad or Bijou. Uber Melanie fans will be sorely depressed. Also if you\&#39;re a fan of crappy movies like me, please do not assume this be a guilty pleasure because you will feel guilty alright, for the money spent on buying or renting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some movies are &#34;so bad that they are good&#34; as the saying goes. What they forgot to add was &#34;so bad that they are good (to pass up).&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NeCRo&#39;

b&#34;How this character ever got hired by the post office is far beyond me. The test that postal workers take is so difficult. There is no way that a guy this stupid can work at the post office. Everyone in this movie is just stupid and that is probably the point of the movie. How they could go their entire lives and not see an elevator is also puzzling. I didn&#39;t take this movie too seriously but it was so stupid. Then he tries to start the car without his keys? Lots of horrible scenes and horrible acting and this movie is not funny at all.

b&#39;A man comes to the office of the psychiatric Dr. Sammael (Joan Severance) claiming to be the demon Asmodeus (Kane Hodder), the torturer of the 13th level of the hell, and he would like to tell weird things. He tells that he had made a deal with Lucifer to become human again. He should knock-up his virgin sister Mary Elizabeth (Alison Brie) on the day that their mother died and she should kill six people and deliver the Anti-Christ, and then he would escape from the pit and reborn. When Mary Elizabeth gets pregnant, her stressed and abusive sister Catherine (Denise Crosby) does not believe that she is virgin, but their father and former obstetrician Albert Martino (James Callahan) examines his daughter and sees her intact hymen. Meanwhile the Church discovers the truth about Mary Elizabeth\&#39;s pregnancy and sends the priest and former military Father Anthony (Eddie Velez) to spy Mary Elizabeth. She is dominated by the fetus and forced to kill a truck driver, Lars (Jorg Sirtl), who is the lover of her tenant and friend Jennifer (Azalea Davila), and Jennifer herself and eat their hearts and drink their bloods, but she believes that she has nightmares. However during the ultrasound, she realizes that she is carrying a monster and she asks her father to stop her pregnancy. But it is too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awful &#34;Born&#34; is a B-movie (actually a Z-movie) that believes that is a great movie. The result is a pretentious and disappointing production, with an incoherent and absurd story without humor and terrible acting and direction. The plot is a complete mess: there is a priest that is a hit-man and former soldier; a demon in existential crisis going to a psychiatric; a father that examines the virginity of his daughter; two female-demons (succubus?) that stand naked like a statue with both hands covering their sexes; a character that is a slut, and only exists to expose her beautiful body. There are many scenes with free and cheap nudity. But the worst is the acting: the unknown lead actress Alison Brie is histrionic, with ridiculous voices and grimaces. Sorry, Ms. Alison Brie, but I hated your annoying performance. I have not recognized Joan Severance, who has a good performance, since I still had the image of her youth. Denise Crosby performs a hateful character and like everybody, she got older but she is still a good actress. I believe that if the writer and the director had included some dark humor and assumed that this movie is a B-movie, the story might have worked better and better. My vote is three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Title (Brazil): &#34;O Anti-Cristo&#34; (&#34;The Anti-Christ&#34;)&#39;

b&#34;This cheap, grainy-filmed Italian flick is about a couple of inheritors of a manor in the Italian countryside who head up to the house to stay, and then find themselves getting killed off by ghosts of people killed in that house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wasn&#39;t impressed by this. It wasn&#39;t really that scary, mostly just the way a cheap Italian film should be. A girl, her two cousins, and one cousin&#39;s girlfriend, head to this huge house for some reason (I couldn&#39;t figure out why) and are staying there, cleaning up and checking out the place. Characters come in and out of the film, and it&#39;s quite boring at points, and the majority of deaths are quite rushed. The girlfriend is hit by a car when fleeing the house after having a dream of her death, and the scene is quite good, but then things get slow again, until a confusing end, when the male cousins are killed together in some weird way, and this weirdo guy (I couldn&#39;t figure out who he was during the movie, or maybe I just don&#39;t remember) goes after this one girl, attacking her, until finally this other girl kills him off. Hate to give away the ending, but oh well. The female cousin decides to stay at the house and watch over it, and they show scenes of her living there years later. The end. You really aren&#39;t missing anything, and anyway, you probably won&#39;t find this anywhere, so lucky you.&#34;

b&#34;Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the TV series of League Of Gentlemen. It was funny, twisted and completely inspired. I was looking forward to the movie, the premise was interesting and I looked forward to see what they had done with the characters and where the bizarre storyline would take them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a total disappointment, for starters the three weakest characters in the series were the leads and it only contained bit parts for the other characters (why not pick mickey &amp; Pauline, papa Lazaro or tubs and Edward for the main parts!?). It was unfunny throughout, half baked gags and poor slapstick humour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The real clincher was the plain ridiculous period drama / comedy (and i will use the word comedy loosely). It distracted from the main storyline and felt awkward, not to mention painfully unfunny. The direction of the movie is appalling, and often feels that the lines were delivered by the characters within one take. Very rushed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then - the three headed Plasticine-esquire monster. What the hell was all that about? plain ridiculous, it felt like the League of gentlemen tagged it on at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I found myself looking at my watch and sighing with disappointment throughout my experience of the film. What was once an amazing Television series has been tainted by a terribly unfunny film. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If i could give it 0 out of 10 i would. Do not waste your money seeing this.&#34;

b&#39;I don\&#39;t get it! The teenage leads in &#34;Horror Star&#34; supposedly all are devoted horror fans, yet when their favorite idol (Conrad Radzoff) passes away, they dig up his corpse and do all sorts of disrespectful stuff with it, like disco-dancing it around the house and throw food leftovers at it. That doesn\&#39;t sound like something real horror fans would do, now does it? I\&#39;m a big horror fan and I immensely idolize departed icons like Vincent Price, Peter Cushing and Boris Karloff, but it would never come to my mind to ridicule their memory. No wonder Conrad comes back from the dead \xc2\x96 admittedly, after a s\xc3\xa9ance \xc2\x96 to wipe them all off the face of the earth! Mr. Radzoff already wasn\&#39;t known for his friendliness in life, since he occasionally killed the directors that disagreed with his visions, and even after his death he suffers from a tremendous ego. Even inside his tomb there are video messages to petrify possible visitors and the group of teenagers will vividly experience that he also enjoys the murdering business outside his film sets. &#34;Horror Star&#34; (a.k.a. &#34;Frightmare&#34; and &#34;Body Snatchers&#34;) is a pretty lame 80\&#39;s horror flick, but there are a handful of cheesy &amp; gory highlights to enjoy. The film mainly suffers from its own stupid plot, since no one \xc2\x96 not even a film school student \xc2\x96 is stupid enough to steal a recently buried corpse and actually think he\&#39;ll get away with it, and there are too many tedious moments to struggle through. Conrad\&#39;s video-speeches from beyond the grave are overly talkative and definitely undermine the tension, but on the other hand his killing methods are pleasingly inventive. One teenager enjoys the experience of getting cremated alive and another one (Jeffrey Combs in one of his first roles!) loses his head in a delightful decapitation sequence. In the absolute messiest sequence, a poor girl\&#39; head is crushed by a coffin. Writer/director Norman Thaddeus Vane wanted to bring homage to vintage horror cinema and he obviously how to make film look sinister. The locations and scenery are great, but Vane lacked the necessary funds to provide his film with a proper continuity and editing-job. The acting performances are overall decent, with Ferdy Mayne (imitating Christopher Lee) and Jeffrey Combs delivering the most memorable roles. &#34;Horror Star&#34; can hardly be called a must-see or even a good film, but it\&#39;s worth tracking down in case you\&#39;re an admirer of enthusiastically made B-horror.&#39;

b&#34;I like vampire movies, I like B-movies, I love B vampire movies. But this one has nearly nothing going for it. Some of the acting is horrible, especially by 3 of the male leads. The story is not particular interesting. At a relative short 88 minutes it still seems too long and you&#39;ll find yourself fast-forwarding quite a bit. There are an awful lot of kung-fu vampire attacks. Sound cool? It isn&#39;t when it&#39;s done on a low budget. It gets repetitive very quickly. There is some minor blood and gore, nothing to get excited about. There some good wire work where you can see the wires. It has some good landscapes being filmed in Puerto Rico. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth the rental&#34;

Now even the gamers who applauded the show initially are turning away in disgust. I look forward to the show&#39;s, and the network&#39;s, overwhelmingly overdue and well-deserved demise.&#34;

b&#34;Even Disney are guilty of the cash cow disease, after the roaring success of The Love Bug in 1968, the house of mouse cashed in with Herbie Rides Again, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo, and Herbie Goes Bananas. Neither sequel capturing the charm and inoffensive appeal of The Love Bug back in 68, in this one we find race driver Jim Douglas and his sidekick Wheely Applegate, entering Herbie in the Monte Carlo Rally. Naturally things outside of the race start to take over priorities, they get mixed up in a diamond robbery and Herbie falls in love with another car!. The car stunts are of course pleasant and easy on the eye, and it would be churlish of me to really vent venom on such a friendly piece of fluff, it&#39;s just that the film goes nowhere fast and personally now i can see it for the coin motivated piece of work it is. Still you get to see Herbie take a bath, foil the baddies and of course dance for the lady in his life, so something there for everyone i think....................4/10.&#34;

b&#39;This movie is a clumsy mishmash of various ghost-story and suspense-thriller conventions, none of them fully realized and all of them rather irritating. The script was perfunctory. The acting, ditto. The scary FX were mostly laughable except for one exquisite seat-jumper moment that scared me even though I saw it coming a mile off. Now, explain to me someone why you would need ghosts, AND black magic, AND arcane ritual objects, AND Count Crapula CG boogeymen, AND psychic investigators, AND family curses, AND Irish superstitions, AND bowls of milk left out for the supernatural beings, AND possessed dollies, all in the same movie? With all that you would expect more than one good moment of horror, but this movie is lame, lame, lame.&#39;

b&#39;A guy, with the unlikely name of Shy Walker, looks for his two daughters in a cornfield for an hour and a half. That\&#39;s the entire plot...with across-the-board bad acting, of course. Walker wanders around a corn maze (maize? I get it! HAHAHA...not funny) and yells &#34;Girls? Where are you?!?&#34; about 1000 times. For some reason whenever he runs by a pumpkin, a chipmunk-sounding voice laughs (as if the pumpkin is laughing at him, yeah OK...). His daughters scream for most of the movie...even when there is no reason to scream (maybe because they are still stuck in this awful movie?). Twin girls straight out of \&#39;The Shining\&#39; show up every now and then. Most of the corn maze looks the same so Walker\&#39;s search gets very old very quickly. The filmmakers realize there is NOTHING going for this movie (even the music is repetitive) so they try to make things interesting by spinning the camera around really fast, filming upside down, inserting smaller pictures of the same shot at different angles, using red lights to make the corn look scary, and rotating the camera 360 degrees (at least I\&#39;m assuming these were done intentionally but it\&#39;s likely just examples of incompetent film-making). More often than not, when Walker is wandering through the maze, you can\&#39;t see his face. I guess the kid holding the camera can\&#39;t look up that high... This movie gives you a new appreciation for the original \&#39;Dark Harvest\&#39; (which doesn\&#39;t have anything to do with this movie except for the fact it also features a cornfield). Don\&#39;t be fooled by the R rating. Walker says the F word three times and now we have &#34;an R-rated horror movie&#34;, ugh. The scarecrow on the cover doesn\&#39;t even show up in this movie...and when you are wishing that those cheesy scarecrows from the first movie would come back, you know things are bad! Instead we get a guy in yellow boots chasing our hero around (unfortunately he is dressed similar to Mr. Walker so I didn\&#39;t even realize he was being followed for a while). I figured out the identity of the guy in the yellow boots long before Walker did (the movie is almost over by the time he puts 2 and 2 together, natch). The end of the movie drags on and on...and just in case it isn\&#39;t slow enough, there\&#39;s some slow-motion! The last sound you hear (besides your own laughter) is very poor sound-dubbing. In case you can\&#39;t tell, this is the worst movie I\&#39;ve ever seen. At least they didn\&#39;t end with the promise of another sequel!&#39;

b&#34;this is a movie which reminds me of avatar- starring rajesh khanna from the 80&#39;s. the issue of parents-kids divide is interesting but was handled in a rather unoriginal manner.. the characters were not developed fully and the kids seemed to go from being extermely loving ( in the first 15mts of the movie) to being totally unconcerned about the parents,, this transformation was not credible to say the least..they sld have explored this a little more. amitabh and jaya were miscast as this helpless old couple.. firstly amit was not too convincing in this role,because he just did not look like he should be helpless, i mean why not just go back to work where he is wanted instead of being w/ kids who didnt want them.. hema was not convincing as a 60 yr old either... she didnt look a day over 50.. then the whole isssue of the book baghban winning the booker prize begged credibility.. all in all, a movie that handles an important issue but cld have been made better, i give it 5/10&#34;

b&#39;Where do I begin, its one of the most frustrating movies I\&#39;ve seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid. A movie about a ghost inhabited bed?? The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie. This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story. Still though, if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early, having a strangulation is the way to do it. Fast forward to the present day, a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things, so far everything\&#39;s normal. Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress, they realize they need a bed frame. This is where things get fishy, why didn\&#39;t they bring or buy a g*d damn bed frame before they got there? We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesn\&#39;t open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame, the door magically opens. They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are saved...or so they thought. The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe. The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if they\&#39;re bring tortured or tied up.(one of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old, yuck) The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie. They find the friendly landlord murdered (which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill) and decide to get the hell out of dodge. While packing up, the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well if you\&#39;ve read this far you have to be thinking one thing.......WHY THE HELL DIDN\&#39;T THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW???? Seriously, they never said anything about the actual house being haunted, just the bed....so why not get rid of the damn thing and move on? That\&#39;s why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth. The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol &#34;oh lets give this place a chance honey&#34; scheme going, so props to that. Still though, me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minutes....why didn\&#39;t they just throw the bed out? Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all its a near-watchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot (to an extent) but the solution is so simple you\&#39;re scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be? The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he can\&#39;t shoot her like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 out of 10 (a low budget porno The Man Show would love)&#39;

b&#34;After high school Track &amp; Field athelete, Laura Remstead, dies of natural causes during a race (an event that is shown multiple times, in slow-motion none-the-less), an unknown killer is murdering all the people who were on that same aforementioned team close to Graduation Day (hence the name)in this laughably inept slasher flick.It brings absolutely nothing new (or even good) to the slasher table, instead opting to merely unleash the most god-awful song I&#39;ve heard in quite some time with &#39; Gangster Rock&#39; being played in a roller-disco party that went on far too long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eye Candy: Denise Cheshire &amp; Linnea Quigley get topless &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Grade: D-&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m sure some people will enjoy it, and find it powerful, or have some sort of personal connection with the characters and story, but from an unbiased stand point, it\&#39;s not very well done. The film revolves around atypical angst-ridden teenagers, each one playing out a different stereotype making us believe this is what it\&#39;s like to be a teenager. We get to see a bit of each teenager\&#39;s lifestyle, but the entire project just came off as pretentious to me, whether it be the constant low angle shots of tree branches in the wind, or the black and white &#34;interviews&#34; with the students, there was nothing new or original showcased in this movie, and nothing I needed to see. Yes, it deals with some strong subject material, and the dramatic scenes are played and acted well, but the entire project seems unnecessary, especially when it seems almost an exact replica to Van Sant\&#39;s &#34;Elephant&#34; (one dealing with suicide, the other with a school shooting). As I said, some people will probably enjoy this, and the director/writer clearly had some sort of inspiration to make this movie based on the death of a close one, so it\&#39;s nice the movie was made with some heart in it, but I feel it\&#39;s incredibly ineffective, and when dealing with material that can be so easily clich\xc3\xa9d to do something original with it. I would not recommend this movie.&#39;

b&#34;Some sciencey people go down in a cave for some reason and there&#39;s some sort of creature that&#39;s killing them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually give a more detailed plot, but I wasn&#39;t paying too much attention to this. Overall, it was dull and the only time you&#39;ll be really paying attention is during the action scenes, which the director did wonderful on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acting is alright, but the characters are so dull and forgettable they blend in your mind. You&#39;ll forget who lived and who died for 2 reasons: 1. The kills are boring 2. The characters are boring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ending might have shocked me more if I knew who was who.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you&#39;re looking for a creatures-in-cave movie?

b&#34;Watchable but pretty terrible. How shocking that this was the great Gregory La Cava&#39;s last directing credit! Even in his better known roles, I don&#39;t care for Gene Kelly. He seems to me to be smug, hostile, and self-involved. Here, paired with a minor actress like Marie Wilson, he seems to show those characteristics in spades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Marie Wilson, playing an heiress who falls for a military man, is exceptionally hard and unsympathetic. The actors seem to be working hard to get past the hard, disagreeable core of the picture and they do OK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The know-it-all butler is apparently meant to be funny but he seems like an extended riff on the prissy bits for which Franklin Pangborn was famous (and in which, despite their stereotyping, he was generally funny -- unlike this guy.) Phyllis Thaxter is as always very appealing in a rather underdeveloped secondary plot.&#34;

b&#34;I would most definitely have to say that this is the most terrible movie I have ever seen. It&#39;s not just the actors that are bad, but also the fact that the camera person taped the wall and the clocks for about 5 minutes at a time. Anyone that likes this must be crazy! THIS MOVIE IS A WASTE OF TIME&#34;

b&#34;Starring: James Belushi; Peter Dinklage; Alex Neuberger and Jason Lee Underdog is a true hero&#39;s tale. Here is the story of Shoeshine, a regular, playful little beagle. When he is dog napped by a megalomaniac midget hell-bent on destruction, something freaky happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our quirky little neighborhood pooch gains extraordinary powers. He can run as fast a cheetah; fly as fast a superhero and has the power of thunder. He is no longer Shoeshine; he is Underdog \xc2\x96 the best crime-fighter in the animal kingdom. The city cannot sleep until Underdog rids it of the evil midget Dr. Simon Barsinister and his cronies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fancy some really light-hearted entertainment with all the clich\xc3\xa9s of superhero action flicks, then this one is for you. As for quality entertainment, this one is strictly for the juniors. Those of you hoping to enjoy the comedy of the fast-fading star -James Belushi - a word of caution: this is not one of his finer works.&#34;

b&#34;I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that&#39;s the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.&#34;

b&#34;It&#39;s schmaltzy, but then what else did you expect? The heroine is Cinderella&#39;s younger sister complete with wicked mother, sister, and brother-in-law; the hero (if you can call him that) is an ineffectual putz; and the rival love interests are full of melodramatic villainy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cast, settings, and wardrobe were all very attractive, and I thought the actors did a superb job considering how weak the material was. The movie was prettily filmed and boasted a soundtrack that was carefully crafted to cue the viewer about what emotions he should be experiencing throughout. Megon McDonough sang sweetly and provided the film with some of its best moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you love Danielle Steel, you will love this film. If you love archetypal romance, you will love this film. I did not. I was able to sit through it, but it was close.&#34;

b&#34;Michael Caine might have tried to make a larger than life character to a successful degree but the whole storyline and Character&#39;s around him where not likable or interesting at all. It was all very Boring and somewhat predictable. Martin Landau , a favorite actor of mine had a nothing role.He was useless. Michael Caine got a bit irritating after a while and the film couldn&#39;t decide if it was a comedy or a serious thriller. Caine tries hard and good on him but i felt the direction and storyline let him down. Don&#39;t waste your time. It starts off well for the first 10 minutes and then that&#39;s about it. A film for Die Hard Caine Fans Only. Stay away from this One...&#34;

b&#39;I just don\&#39;t get it. Why call this a sequel to the film &#34;American Werewolf&#34; when it has absolutely NO connection with it whatsoever? The first film was funny *and* scary with ground breaking special effects. (If memory serves, the Oscar category for special make-up effects was *created* for this movie). &#34;Paris&#34; is none of these things. Awful effects, and not much else. Do not see this movie. Rent the original &#34;Werewolf in London&#34; instead. You\&#39;ll be much happier.&#39;

b&#34;Bloody Birthday opens to a shot of Meadowvale General Hospital. There three babies are being born at precisely the same time during a total eclipse. A caption informs us that it is now &#39;Meadowvale, California June 1, 1980&#39;. Two teenage lovers, Duke Benson (Ben Marley) and Annie Smith (Erica Hope) are getting down to business in an open grave. They hear noises and Duke investigates. Both Duke and Annie are murdered. Sheriff Jim Brody (Bert Kramer) is baffled and only has the handle of a child&#39;s skipping rope that Annie was holding, as a clue. Unfortunately before Sheriff Brody can solve the case his youngest daughter Debbie (Elizabeth Hoy) and two of her friends Curtis Taylor (Billy Jayne as Billy Jacoby) and Steven Seton (Andy Freeman) murder him. Just as they are finishing Sheriff Brody off another young boy from their class named Timmy Russel (K.C. Martel) turns up, the three killers are unaware of how much he saw. Soon after the incident Timmy plays with Steven and Curtis in a junkyard. Curtis locks Timmy into an old locker. Timmy manages to escape and tell his sister Joyce (Lori Lethin), but she doesn&#39;t believe him at first. The three children carry on their murder spree. Their strict teacher Miss Davis (Susan Strasberg) a lovemaking couple (John Avery and Sylvia Wright) in a van and Debbie&#39;s older sister Beverly (Julie Brown) are among their victims. Joyce begins to have her suspicions about Debbie, Curtis and Steven which makes her and Timmy a target for the evil trio. Will they be able to convince the authorities that these three innocent looking 10 year olds are really soulless killers?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Co-written and directed by Ed Hunt I have an intense dislike for this film. I think it&#39;s absolutely awful and doesn&#39;t have a single enjoyable aspect to it&#39;s 83 minute running time. The script by Hunt and Barry Pearson gives us no explanation for the child killers motives beyond the solar eclipse that blocks out Saturn and therefore for some bizarre astrological reason these three children don&#39;t have any conscience, so these are the only children ever born during a total eclipse? If that is true why do they wait until just before their tenth birthday&#39;s before starting their killing spree? I guess it just suddenly kicks in, right? To it&#39;s credit it is reasonably well paced but I still found it incredibly boring and tedious to sit through. The film as a whole is very unexciting and predictable, the children are revealed as the killers within the first 10 minutes and as I&#39;ve mentioned next to no motive is given. It&#39;s very silly at times, too. Check out the scene where Debbie stops Steven by throwing a bowl of water over him! The Sheriff&#39;s death is put down to him falling down some steps, yeah right the injuries suffered from that type of accident aren&#39;t going to be the same as if your beaten to death with a baseball bat like he was in reality, any competent Doctor or Pathologist would have spotted that within 5 seconds. There isn&#39;t a single drop of blood spilt in the entire film and all of the lame killings are dull and unimaginative. There is some out-of-place looking nudity as Debbie charges 25c to let boys peek through a hole while her sister Beverly strips. There is an early scene just after the 5 minute mark when Joyce walks from the kitchen to the living room and the boom mike is clearly visible at the top of the screen, not even a little bit of it the whole damn thing. The general incompetence continues throughout the film. The whole production is bland and instantly forgettable. The acting is poor throughout, those three kids are very annoying and got on my nerves right from the start and made sitting through this film even more of a chore, especially Curtis in his geeky over-sized glasses. I just hate this film really, simple as that. I can&#39;t think of a single good thing to say about it. Definitely one to avoid.&#34;

b&#34;I&#39;m generally not a fan of high school comedies, they rely heavily on humor in bad taste and rarely stray far from clich\xc3\xa9d story lines and characters and downright dull dialog. However, I&#39;ve had my share of guilty pleasures, particularly when I was still in high school myself. Seeing the oh-so-recognizable teacher figures get their butts kicked always cheered me up and an occasional laugh could also be the case. These movies only work if at least one of the characters is an instantly likable one, this was not the case in &#39;Cheats&#39;, especially not the protagonist. Of course, it didn&#39;t help that the actor in play was one of the most irritating, no-talent, arrogant kids I&#39;ve ever seen in a comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To act in a comedy is no joke, it&#39;s hard to be funny: the delivery has to be just right or the material goes to waste. In this case there wasn&#39;t much good stuff to begin with and the jokes that were half-funny were screwed up professionally by the cast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This movie felt 3 hours long, the director never heard of pacing obviously. Stay away from this one, there are many other enjoyable teen comedies out there such as 10 Things I Hate About You, Who&#39;s Your Daddy and Superbad.&#34;

b&#34;I have to say that this movie was not what i expected. Even though i have not read the book the fact that plants can one bait and then wait for a killing to happen only to have it drag off a corpse for lunch is about the worst scenario anyone has come up with. With the title ruins you would think that out of 3000 years that some kind of deity or ancient animal or god would be the culprit. This is like another movie primeval where you would think it was something strange that villagers fear the most, but not a crocodile. Either way this film was like that, it entices you to think about ruins of Mayan or Inca folklore resulting in awakening and old god or the people had another agenda for sacrifice or something to that effect. But plants?.... come on, is there nothing else producers can come up with to wow a crowd?. As for this movie it will hit the &#39;b&#39; list in no time. I have to say that some of the gore was excellent to see, but it didn&#39;t make up for the rest of the film. And a plant mimicking a cell phone sound or peoples voices is just too much to be believed. I am a fan of horror films but i am not a stereo typed fan who relies on just gore or mechanical effects. I do rely on great suspense and whats the next scene going to bring for more suspense. The thing had a better story line than this did. Even the ring had me jumping for more, but the ruins is just that..... ruined for using a plant to coax victims into killing or be killed by the villagers. The premise was alright for the villagers to keep it at bay with salt and such but still a simple blow torch and lots of napalm can easily do the trick to end those pesky plants with a flesh eating disorder.&#34;

b&#39;Flipping through the TV and saw that The Secret Life of was on; gave George Duran a shot at being the host. I know that Jim O\&#39;Connor was very energetic and that nobody could be as much as him, but George was well dull. He really didn\&#39;t seem to want to be hosting; his voice-overs were monotonous, didn\&#39;t get involved with the guests. It seemed like he was interviewing guests for Unwrapped, and he just happened to be in the shot. I don\&#39;t know if George is going to get &#34;better&#34; hosting this show, I doubt it because he has hosted his own show now. The show did seem to pack more info in, but only because we saw less of the host. The formula of this show was very delicate, and I fear it has now been disrupted for good.&#39;

b&#39;I have a question for the writers and producers of &#34;Prozac Nation&#34;: What is the root cause and what is the solution to the widespread problem of personal depression in America? In the moving performance of Christina Ricci as Liz Wurtzel, the film portrays a young woman with unlimited potential as a Harvard student and as a writer. But this is not a story of success, only one of self-destruction as we watch Liz bring misery into the lives everyone who comes in contact with her. The film examines divorce, family dysfunction, drugs, alcohol, and prescription medication as possible reasons for Liz\&#39;s unhappiness. But none of those superficial explanations are satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At some point in the film, it would have been helpful to suggest that Liz needs to take responsibility for her life and her problems. No light was shed on what the film alleged to be a runaway problem in &#34;The United States of Depression.&#34; In the story, Liz had a caring therapist (Anne Heche), a caring roommate (Michele Williams), a caring boyfriend (Jason Biggs), and a troubled but caring parent (Jessica Lange). In a key scene in the film, Liz is lying in a hospital bed watching the break-up of the space shuttle Challenger. Instead of equating Challenger with Liz\&#39;s life, the film should have used the image as a starting point for her healing and recovery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This film reminded me of a generic made-for-cable &#34;victim&#34; film on the Lifetime network. An excellent cast was wasted, especially in the earnest performance of Christina Ricci. The real-life Elizabeth Wurtzel obviously found within herself the resources to cope with her depression and become a successful author. It is unfortunate that the film could not offer us even the slightest glimpse into her courageous spirit.&#39;

b&#39;The script seems to have been wholesale (ahem ahem, cough cough) &#34;borrowed&#34; from a certain other movie involving using a self-propelled manned drilling machine. Scene by scene, the two movies were almost identical. Just enough of the serial numbers filed off in this one to prevent a copyright infringement lawsuit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, I have to say I found this somewhat entertaining as I enjoy deep-underground-in-the-earth genre of movies. It\&#39;s a little bit on the stupid side as far as the science goes, but if one is willing to squint one\&#39;s eyes real hard and pretend one didn\&#39;t notice that scientific gaffe here and there and all over, this movie is almost bearable. Far better than &#34;Supernova&#34; which was another flick that Luke Perry had a leading role in that was so dumb, dumb, dumb that nothing could save it. A note to movie makers: employ someone who knows something about the subject the movie deals with. It would be a very small part of the movie budget, but it would have a big effect overall in helping prevent your audience from guffawing at you for doing dumb science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production values: almost passable. I\&#39;ve seen far worse in my time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A new thought for disaster movies: instead of them always having a happy ending where the world gets saved yet once again, how about some where things are a tad bit more realistic, where sometimes even the very best efforts still end up in failure. Particularly when the problem that needs to be resolved was caused in the first place by sheer stupidity. Stupidity-caused disaster movies with glowing, heartwarming endings sort of backhandedly justify stupidity by stating, &#34;No matter how awful a problem is caused by braindead stupidity, it can be fixed.&#34; Which is definitely not the case. A self-caused disaster movie with an unhappy ending would serve better as cautionary tale of &#34;Don\&#39;t be so damn stupid in the first place.&#34; Should you watch this movie? If you\&#39;re bored and you\&#39;ve seen everything else in the scifi section at your local video rental store, sure, why not. But do avoid &#34;Supernova&#34; as I can assure you that you\&#39;re not THAT bored. That definitely was not one of Luke Perry\&#39;s better movies. This one is better. That\&#39;s not saying much, but it is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One dead hoof up for being a deep-underground genre movie. One dead hoof down for naughtily ripping off from the screenplay of another certain movie of the same genre.&#39;

b&#39;(SMALL SPOILERS) I just bought the DVD of this movie yesterday. I saw it with my friends and I couldn\&#39;t believe what had happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first 3 movies, the critters at least had a sense of humor (especially the 3rd movie), but not only did the critters barely ever make an appearance, they weren\&#39;t funny! They never made me laugh. I must admit that the story did start off nicely. After an hour had gone by I remembered that the Critters movies were always very short. So I thought to myself, &#34;Where the $^%#$ are the critters?!?!&#34; They were barely in this movie! If that didn\&#39;t make me mad enough, the boy named Ethan was sitting on his bed after Charlie had &#34;murdered the ship&#34; and he knew that the critters were still on board! In the first movie the Brown family was scared out of their minds. But here, Ethan didn\&#39;t even care! It was as if the critters weren\&#39;t even a threat!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now what I\&#39;m about to say next may ruin the ending, but I\&#39;m going to say it anyways. In the first movie, at the end, they had to face the giant critter for a final battle. In the second one, there was the great ball of critter. In the third movie, the critter with his fave burned did a spindash (from Sonic the Hedgehog) and was going to attack the little kid. But at the end of the fourth one (which is what made me the angriest) the bald critter charges toward Ethan, and Ethan kills it as if it were nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now something that I really don\&#39;t understand was what happened to Ug. He was one of my favorite characters in the first two. Then after 50 years, he\&#39;s evil. That was very disappointing. Not only that, but wasn\&#39;t he a faceless bounty hunter? Why was he still &#34;Johnny Steele?&#34; Plus he seemed to have a different personality. He seemed much smarter and not as monotone like in the first two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being someone who actually enjoyed the first two critters movies, and loved the third one, I give Critters 4 a 2/10&#39;

b&#39;I really wanted to love this film. I have read the book to my daughters and we all loved it. The book is marvelous. This film is very far from the book. The book is splendid - this film is an awful adaptation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the book, Sara is honorable, kind, strong, and NEVER does anything spiteful to get back at anyone. That\&#39;s the POINT of the book! She behaves as a &#34;princes&#34; regardless of circumstances. An important part of behaving like a princess is to not return unkindness. It is to behave honorably regardless of how you are being treated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the book, she endures much and touches the lives of others. Other people change their behaviors after they witnessed her kindness and ability to endure without sinking to spite and vengefulness. Sara does what is right simply BECAUSE it is RIGHT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside of the bakery, she comes upon a beggar girl who is more poor and hungry than she is. She has half a dozen hot buns. She is VERY hungry. She gives one bun to this wild looking little girl huddled on the doorstep of the bakery. When she sees how ravenous the girl is and watches her gobble the bun, she gives her another. She continues to do this until she has given 3 or 4 I think - I don\&#39;t remember how many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The baker is watching through the window. She is so moved by what she has witnessed, she takes the beggar girl in and raises her as her own daughter. Other people are similarly influenced by Sara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in the book, her father has died. The man next door is her father\&#39;s partner - he has been looking for her. Her father did not lose his money after all - the man is thrilled to find Sara; he takes her and Becky into his home and raises them as his daughters. And Sara has her full inheritance, of course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miss Minchin is not a chimney sweep. In fact, she remains in her same post at the school. But she is humiliated as Sara has told her new guardian of the cruel treatment she received. And Sara does speak to Miss Minchin in the end - Miss Minchin is trying to minimize her treatment of Sara and Sara with a calm steadfast demeanor, instructs Miss Minchin that she had been cruel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no comeuppance for Miss Minchin. She continues on in her miserable existence. It does not matter - what matters is that Sara has a home with a guardian who loves her - and her dearest friend in the world, Becky, is now for all intents and purposes, her sister.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The book is about love and honorable behavior under the worst of circumstances. It is about self control and humility. It is a wonderful book. This film does NOTHING to capture the true story and messages of the book. My wife was so disgusted with it, she wanted to leave the theater in the middle, but we decided to stick it out. We were not rewarded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot for the life of me think of a reason the film makes should alter this excellent book in such a bad direction. Perhaps it was the influence of the ghastly screenplay from the book that Shirley Temple acted in. I don\&#39;t know - but this film is so far from the book in character and values that I do not recognize it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don\&#39;t waste your time - buy the book. It is unforgettable... even for a dad!&#39;

b&#34;With such a promising cast and a director that I have heard great things about, I was utterly disappointed by this film. It started off with signs of a great epic gangster tale and turned into a completely muddled mess with many unanswered questions and some completely ridiculous and pointless scenes.(and yes I did watch the full length version). I love Robert DeNiro and as usual he did a fine acting job, but in all his other gangster films, no matter how many people he kills, I always still had respect for his character, but in this movie he was a lowlife drug-addict, rapist with no care for anyone but himself. Also, James Woods, another fine actor, had some completely ridiculous scenes written for him. I thought the parts where Robert DeNiro called him crazy and he flipped out came completely out of left-field and towards the end the writers just throw in this random comment about how his father died in a nut house and that&#39;s why James Woods didn&#39;t like being called crazy. So much was left undeveloped in this movie. Also, we never find out who the men are in the beginning that are trying to kill Noodles and we never find out more about Joe Pesci&#39;s character. It seems that the writers threw together about five different stories and never fully explained any of them. The only redeeming quality of the film was the story when the characters were young kids. The story ran smoothly in this part of the movie and the kids did a great acting job. Overall, I was thoroughly disappointed by this movie and I don&#39;t see how anyone can even compare this to the Godfather 1 and 2, or even Goodfellas.

b&#39;Dreadful, stupidly inane film dealing with corruption at the Louisiana Purchase Lumber Company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone in the state of Louisiana seems to be corrupt and inept. A member of the college\&#39;s English Department can only sign his name with an X.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it appears that a straight laced Senator (Victor Moore) is coming to the state to investigate, everyone there tries to blame the innocent but foolish Bob Hope character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it any wonder that Vera Zorina did not get the part of Maria in 1943\&#39;s &#34;For Whom the Bell Tolls?&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Naturally, the corrupt officials along with Hope try to show pictures of Zorina with Moore so as to ruin him politically. Moore marries the head of the restaurant who he had insulted when he asked for a ham sandwich. He thought the reason that she was upset was because it was a kosher restaurant. This is the extent of humor is this absolute mess of a film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Hope tries to defend himself in Congress, he does a take-off of James Stewart in &#34;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.&#34; By then the film is too far gone for any good response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The music and lyrics are both absolutely terrible. That song praising Louisiana, sung in various ways, is absolutely terrible. Irving Berlin had something to do with the music of this utterly terrible film?&#39;

b&#39;The plot: Four people are caught in an elevator. One is a business man, the annoying kind who is aggressive and complains about everything and everyone and is a walking-talking sample of distilled stress and hostility. Then there\&#39;s his colleague, a woman who is much more pleasant in her character. A teenage rebel who just broke into a coke machine and by his mere presence drives the businessman mad, and an older guy who just stole 100,000DM make up the rest of the cast...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie is all about how they cope with their problem, as time goes on and on without any success in reaching the outside world, as the lights go out, and as the cables begin to snap one after the other....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yet, it isn\&#39;t too exciting. The characters are stereotypes. The story is stupid and unlikely (how could so many things go so wrong in just one elevator?). You don\&#39;t like the characters very much, you just hate one of them. And all the twists and turns in the plot are not contributing to the excitement, they are just stupid excuses for filling yet another few minutes with dialogue as the screenwriters keep running out of inspiration and ink on a full-length movie set in an elevator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let\&#39;s just hope &#34;Phone Booth&#34; will be a better effort...&#39;

b&#39;I saw &#34;Mirrormask&#34; last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a film that is visually rich but with slow direction, poor plot line and 2-dimensional characterisation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did, however, know this when I went in. I was willing to trust the two gentleman that I went with (knowledgable comic buffs) that the visuals would be out of the ordinary and so they were. Unfortunately, inexperience of direction meant that scene after scene passed with little in the way of dramatic tension or conflict. Though, this is a comment that could be made of many artists whose work is transferred to screen and who are given charge of direction. The pace of the story is lost as the camera lovingly dwells on the pretty pictures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not have gone at all without that reassurance that the style of the film would be worth seeing. I have tried with Neil Gaiman\&#39;s work but am always left with the &#34;emperor\&#39;s new clothes&#34; feeling. I live in hope but last night was no exception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not think I can continue with an analysis of Gaiman\&#39;s work without losing the will to live. Read the rest of the comments and all his faults are eloquently described. I cannot comprehend, however, how he imagined that he had any understanding of the mind of a fifteen year old girl, Nor that what he had to say added anything to the sum total of human knowledge on growing up and assuming adult responsibility, or the changing relationship that a girl might have with her mother. These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination. All the pretty pictures in the world cannot make up for a piece of work that is flawed at the core.&#39;

b&#34;Ever watched something so awful you just have to keep watching to be sure it really is as bad as it looks? This is one of those films. It was slammed by the critics on it&#39;s release, not least for the way it was funded. I caught it on TV last night and gave in to curiosity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event, it is what it says on the box, no more nor less: low level humour, crudity, very much in the &#39;Carry On...&#39; vein but with &#39;adult&#39; language. Indeed, it harks back to the 60s/70s UK porn industry, cheating punters by promising real sex and not delivering (spot the nipple?) That whole tawdry era is lovingly recreated here but with modern cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has the benefit of Mackenzie Crook (The Office, Pirates of the Caribbean and much more) and also Johnny Vegas. The chip shop girl is genuinely sexy. Beyond these unexpected positives, it does leave me wondering what happened to England. Junk food, low paid work, council estates, desperate lives. As a bonus, there are some nice shots of leafy Birmingham. Foreigners might find it informative about British attitudes and aspirations. Overall, though, I still feel disbelief that I sat through it.&#34;

b&#34;The movie contains a very short scene of Deneuve in a bathtub. She looks absolutely stunning for a lady age 56, but this is the only saving grace of the movie. Otherwise, it has a mindless, unmotivated script and the lead actress has none of Deneuve&#39;s appeal. The director apparently watched too many Peter Greenaway films and Pola X comes across as a student&#39;s imitation of the Greenaway style, without any of his inspiration.&#34;

b&#34;Wow.. where do I begin. I rented this movie because it sounded like something I would be interested in watching. With a name like Val Kilmer starring in this film, I thought how bad could it be? This has got to be the worst film I have ever seen with such a big name attached to it. I was wondering why it slipped through the cracks and I never remember hearing anything about it when it first came out. It starts out pretty good, and is somewhat reminiscent of the intro sequence in the bourne identity, but after the initial 30 minutes or so it goes from bad to worse and then it ventures into WTF land. If you haven&#39;t seen this, do yourself a favor and don&#39;t rent/buy it unless you are a masochist or on a quest to see every Val Kilmer film out there. There are many more titles out there that are more deserving your time. This film (if you can call it that) is a bona fide waste of time. I want my 82 minutes back.&#34;

b&#39;I\&#39;m sure there is a documentary amongst the ruins of this Yawn-fest somewhere, given enough time maybe the producers could find it. I do not connect with any of the characters. This is a problem for a documentary. That disconnection soon festers into a complete animosity bordering on hostility. Although because of the poor story flow, I\&#39;m not really sure what is happening to them and what are the consequences of whatever it is they are trying to do. The story and faces jump around so quickly it is very hard to completely understand what is going on. The 3rd founder that takes them for $700K is introduced so late into the film, Khaleil and Tom have to backpaddle (fruitlessly) to explain &#34;oh yeah, this guy created the idea too&#34;. And just when I thought I had a slight grasp on who all the tertiary characters were, some crazy woman in ranting about getting a puppy? What\&#39;s up with that? Also, did Tom really have to give all those awkward speeches to the staff? I can only imagine the boredom they felt when it was really happening. Actually I think I feel for them.&#39;

b&#39;Thankfully I watched this film alone, enabling me to fast-forward through the worst scenes (aka most of the film, actually). OK, some of it is not all bad, with partially good photography (even some of the under water scenes) and at times not too bad directing. But it still doesn\&#39;t save the incredibly poor script and way worse acting. Additionally, when I don\&#39;t find the movies &#34;hottie&#34; to be all that, even the wannabe-sexy love making scenes get dull. Really dull! And for the drama: You know it\&#39;s always a bad sign when you get to dislike all of the characters so much you really don\&#39;t care who lives and who dies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you still haven\&#39;t gotten tired of the reality series Survivor, you may find something to your liking in this movie. If not, stay well clear!&#39;

b&#39;When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one. Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD ( they had not viewed it on the silver screen ), my opinion remains the same. The subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak.&#39;

b&#39;This movie just stunk. I know that some people will say that anybody who thinks it is no good &#34;just doesn\&#39;t get it.&#34; I like Wenders in American Friend and Wings of Desire. But this is utter dreck. The main character is so annoying that I couldn\&#39;t care less what he does. He is, as has been said in another review bouncing around like a little annoying monkey. I just couldn\&#39;t stand him or force myself to care. This is the case with most of the characters who just seem to be trying to hard to be goofey or weird. I liked the Mel Gibson character and the Milla Jovovich characters and wish they would have focused more on them. Milla is of course beautiful, pitiful and you really feel for her and what she has been thru and why she is the way she is. I see Gibsons character as almost Frankenstien like. I just wish he would have save Milla and brunt the hotel down with all the worthless boring characters that lived in it. Milla Rating 10 Movie rating 0&#39;

b&#34;After watch this movie I was surprised that someone had like it!!!! I think this is the worst comedy I ever seen....ever!!!! If you think you had already seen the worst comedy made wait for watch this crap!!!! Not funny at all( OK one or two laugh maybe.......but you have to be really high), the acting is terrible and the story doesn&#39;t exist. Even if you like snowboarding ( and I really do) you will hate this movie. OK, OK you can see some nice babes , some nice snowboarding tricks and some beautiful mountains but that&#39;s all!!! Watch a porno set in the mountains instead because the acting and the story line might be better!!!!! Sometimes in IMDb I read bad review about some movie and at the end they are not so awful....but this one, believe me,is pure trash!!!! Don&#39;t waste your time and money in this one.&#34;

b&#39;I rented this type of &#34;soft core&#34; before, but I can honestly say, I wasn\&#39;t expecting this to be in the same type as &#34;Rod Steele: You Only Live Until You Die&#34;--which was both sexy AND funny. It had a good script, a sincere leading man, and a sense of purpose. It also has Gabriella Hall who is hot. The reason why I didn\&#39;t expect this movie, was because the box was missing the &#34;Must be 18 to Rent&#34; Sticker. I was looking for more &#34;cheese&#34; and less &#34;cheesecake.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I think movies shouldn\&#39;t be allowed to start with &#34;actors&#34; rehearsing for a part at a talent agency (or wherever &#34;actors&#34; rehearse). In this movies seeing the &#34;actors&#34; rehearsing highlights the lack of preparation that went into acting out the real characters in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, having found out that this WAS a soft core movie, I didn\&#39;t necessarily turn it off and demand my money back. But, the dizzying way the extended video &#34;erotic&#34; scenes are added to what was probably a late night pay-cable release are very annoying and easy to fast-forward through without the sustained quality of, say, Rod Steele. You know they must\&#39;ve had some money, because I think some of it is filmed overseas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say the main actor trying NOT to spill the invisibility potion on himself is one of the most baffling acting jobs I\&#39;ve ever seen. And, I\&#39;ve seen Torgo from Manos! It may actually have been worth the dollar rental fee (that and Gabriella Hall). Still, there are better corny movies to rent with your friends.&#39;

b&#39;While I am a long-time Shatner fan (since we used to watch Trek re-runs over the dinner hour in the early \&#39;70s), I cannot think of any possible reason why he wanted to do this film, whether for personal development or business reasons. Did he lose a bet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a movie fan, I like to appreciate the bad films along with the great ones. But &#34;Shoot or be Shot&#34; doesn\&#39;t have any flair or funny bits, unintentional or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While unrated, there were no objectionable scenes (blink or you\&#39;ll miss it nudity, cartoonish gunfire &#34;violence&#34; with the endless bullet gunfights), so one is led to believe that the producers merely wanted to save the fee required to get the MPAA to rate it. This will make its way to cable with barely 10 seconds edited out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the eight people that were in the theatre with us, four of them left mid-way, muttering statements like &#34;This is stupid&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shatner plays an escaped mental patient who has been denied release because he views himself as a screenwriter. The examination board stamps his request &#34;INSANE&#34;. He runs into a group of Z-grade moviemakers who &#34;shoot on video because its 80% cheaper than film&#34; and decides to force them to shoot his script at gunpoint. There are a few minor subplots that develop some of the secondary characters, but for the most part, that is the whole movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to spend 90 minutes on a Shatner &#34;art&#34; film, see &#34;Free Enterprise&#34; instead, it is a much better film.&#39;

b&#34;This was a letdown in many ways. The location filming in Ireland, though quite beautiful at times, cannot save this uninspired flick. Greg Evigan and Alexandra Paul, as the married couple trying to get their marriage back on track and who inherit a haunted mansion, just aren&#39;t interesting characters. Paul, towards the end of the film, becomes incredibly annoying and one wishes she would just close her mouth and shut up, as it seems she is screaming as if it has just become an Olympic event! Other problems with this film are odd segments that have nothing to do with the core of the film, such as the opening sequence with two cleaning women and the woman in a bed with a severed hand climbing over her writhing, naked body. Although the woman is quite adequate doing this it does nothing storywise. One is left thinking the production team needed to pad out a short running time and just tossed in some padding and a bit of T and A. The CGI effects are cartoonish as well and the fiery finale rivals co-executive producer Roger Corman&#39;s much earlier and far superior film The Fall Of The House Of Usher in all its ineffective cheapness. Any attempt at true tension and suspense, and as a result chills, are thrown out the window in this low budget bust. If you like images of Ireland you might find something here but you would do better renting or buying a travelogue. Skip this unless you are undiscriminating and think plot is secondary. Rent another low budget ghost story(if you can find it) titled The Woman In Black and see how good and scary a movie can be. This was a wasted opportunity.&#34;

b&#39;Okay, so I forgot to watch and only caught the last episode, thinking it was the first or second. Honestly, I thought CM would have at least one more installment to resolve plot points. The Rangers are left stranded on the plains (&#34;We\&#39;ll have to eat the horses&#34;), for one thing. Little Newt is bereft, for another. What a downer ending! But my biggest complaint, esp. if this was the finale, is that the episode had no suspense, no big climax, no dramatic confrontations. Even the last fight between Blue Duck and Buffalo Hump was badly staged. The whole episode had terrible pacing, which is what drives a Western. Steve Zahn was watchable, Karl Urban (a ringer for Johnny Knoxville) played Call like a man with a terminal case of lockjaw. All glowering looks and jingling spurs and jutting chin. And what\&#39;s with the Rangers? They talked big, about cleaning up Texas, then milled around aimlessly in the middle of town, getting drunk. And how nice of Hal Holbrook to loan Val Kilmer his Mark Twain wig and stache! The set of Austin was like the fake Rock Ridge from Blazing Saddles, all facade. I admit I was drawn into the plot, but that\&#39;s mainly cause there were many things I didn\&#39;t quite get, thanks to coming in late in story. If I\&#39;d watched from the beginning, I might not have gotten to episode three. Now I have to go watch Silverado to cleanse my palette.&#39;

b&#39;I will leave it to my bettors, uhh, betters here to gape and gawk at this wonderful wonderawful movie, and just say that I thought it stunk. The great thing about this site is you always get a variety of views, and seek them out, by all means. No telling what you will come out of the film with. For me, the ones who saw through the simplicities and shenanigans of it have my money. There was one, dead on perfect when he pointed out the two grand moments of the thing, which belong to Pacino. The meeting and the airport. Other than that, well, what a waste of time. Utterly. Pacino is just doing the same thing over and over and over, he would have been better served by taking the performance down about five notches at about the level of his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Everybody always says, but this movie could have been so much better. Sure they all could have been. But really most of them just should never have been made. Including this one.&#39;

b&#39;AKA &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aspect ratio: 3 x 1.78:1 within 2.39:1 frame (Triptych) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sound format: Dolby Digital&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1978: A working class teenager (Matthew Leitch) assumes a false identity and gatecrashes high society, where he learns harsh lessons about the divisions between Rich and Poor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autobiographical feature by director Duncan Roy (JACKSON: MY LIFE... YOUR FAULT), an expos\xc3\xa9 of the pre-Thatcherite aristocracy, as seen through the eyes of a low-rent \&#39;commoner\&#39; whose world view is transformed by his adventures amongst the Upper Classes. Unfortunately, Roy\&#39;s screenplay says very little we didn\&#39;t already know about the excesses of the idle rich, and the narrative is only briefly ignited by Leitch\&#39;s relationship with a handsome but self-destructive rent boy (Peter Youngblood Hills) who turns out to be no less hypocritical than the very people he seeks to emulate. Also starring Diana Quick (as an outrageous snob who believes working class people are &#34;embarrassed to be alive&#34;!), Bill Nighy as the black sheep of a wealthy family, Lindsay Coulson (&#34;EastEnders&#34;), Blake Ritson (DIFFERENT FOR GIRLS) and Georgina Hale in a typically flamboyant cameo, flashing her boobs at all and sundry, without a care in the world! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, much of the film\&#39;s impact is diluted by Roy\&#39;s insistence on using a Triptych effect (three separate 1.78:1 images are letterboxed within the 2.39:1 frame, each one providing a different viewpoint of individual scenes), which shrinks the image and distances viewers from events on-screen. A long, pointless film, too personal for wide appeal, and hampered throughout by a cinematic process which fails to reconcile the story at hand. A single-image version is also available (framed theatrically at 1.85:1), with the on-screen title AKA: LIES ARE LIKE WISHES.&#39;

b&#39;This is a voice of a person, who just finished watching the second season of Rome, almost at one go, and grabbed the opportunity to see &#34;what happened next&#34; - this film conveniently takes off where Rome ends. If you find Rome an abomination, a foul mouthed screw-fest of little historical accuracy, then you might enjoy Imperium: Augustus. But, if you feel Rome is a good thing, if you enjoy the complicated intrigue, the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors, then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid, superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in Rome. I especially disliked Rome\&#39;s image of Cleopatra as a drug-soaked sex addict. There must have been a great deal of strength and dignity in that woman, and the actress in Imperium suits the part much better. O\&#39;Toole and Rampling are good, and so are some others. But then... If you have come to know - and love - Atia as the super cool bitch, you\&#39;ll find the depiction of her in Imperium - as a tear-jerking mother goose in an apron - absolutely ridiculous. There are supposed to be some bitchy characters in Imperium, but these actresses rely heavily upon staring at the men and nothing much more. You\&#39;ll find no interesting female characters in this epic. There\&#39;s also the painfully comic Maecenas, whom we see as a screeching drag queen, even though there is little historical evidence that he was such (he\&#39;s once referred to as &#34;being effeminate in his pleasures&#34; in the annals).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The interiors are rather meager and rely on clich\xc3\xa9s upon clich\xc3\xa9s. Cleopatra\&#39;s big hall looks like something out of a computer game or a children\&#39;s play room in an Egyptian theme park. There\&#39;s a looooooooot of really poor 3D graphics, not up to 2003 standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The action is presented as a series of flashbacks the aged Augustus is reliving. So we get a quick look at some historical events, some of which are presented well, whereas some are not. An disproportional amount of time is wasted to show Livia as the &#34;eternal flame&#34; of Augustus. This affair doesn\&#39;t sizzle for even a moment, the dialog is superlame and everything is seasoned with tacky tear-inducing musical score. Whatever amount of reality the show aims to capture, every last shred of it is destroyed by the dry synchronized dubbing (most of the actors are non English speakers).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything is lukewarm in this epic. True, there are more historical accuracies than in Rome, but dramatically speaking, it\&#39;s plain boring. The characters lack depth and the dialog sharpness. Camera-work is often reduced to static shots, and lighting offers nothing to please your eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There\&#39;s really no-one to love and no-one to hate in Imperium. Regardless of whether you liked or disliked Rome, there are much better films and miniseries around. Ancient Rome: The Rise and Fall of an Empire would be one thing I recommend.&#39;

b&#39;If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. The humor is the cruelest I have ever seen in a film. Horrible things happen to good people and people who have already suffered horribly through no fault of their own. There are 2 plots, neither of which supports half of a film. Where is the &#34;depth&#34; others see in this movie? That no good deed goes unpunished? That only the heartless can succeed? The film does start well and the black and white is very moody and well done. The acting is very good and convincing witch makes the cruel humor even more horrifying. If you think that the 3 Stooges are too nice to each other, if watching the beheading of a kidnap victim with a Bowie knife is a real thigh slapper, if you thought &#34;Schindler\&#39;s List&#34; was hilarious, then this movie is for you.&#39;

b&#39;Five Fingers relies heavily on barbaric, shock value Hollywood tactics to elicit apparently a positive movie-going response. This is where this movie fails throughout, primarily because it is too graphic to be taken seriously. I was repulsed and disgusted that Five Fingers was even made, and essentially had to force myself to continue watching it. Torture in and of itself is gruesome. Even the sounds coming from a room where someone is being tortured are gruesome. But obviously the makers of this stinker of a movie felt that was not enough. It had to go way beyond what was needed, and simply and effectively ruined any chances this movie had of making some sort of valid point. For this reason, this movie came across as nothing more than being self-gratifying. Five Fingers also pretty much relegates itself to a B-movie status solely by its indulgence on manipulation of time. In other words we are shown the present and then the past is revealed in snippets. This is a little bit of a twist of the normal Hollywood manipulation of time. Whereas the viewer normally is shown page 95 in a 100 page script as the beginning of the movie, and then the rest of the flick is essentially explaining the ending, Five Fingers is dedicated to flashing back, which gets quite tiring by the end of the movie. Overall, Five Fingers made me feel stupid for watching the whole movie, because torture is obviously obscene, and it certainly was not necessary to resort to graphic mutilation to make this point. I am surprised that Dick Cheney did not make a guest cameo appearance at the end as some sort of torture superhero. This movie is a perfect example of what happens when an important topic falls into the hands of greedy, mindless dolts.&#39;

b&#39;I just watched this movie with a few friends they said I had to see it but from the beginning i knew it was going to go from bad to worse. So I can only give this movie a 1 because the effects that were used were so poorly used and thought out that anyone can see that there were no &#34;real&#34; ghosts. I feel the worst part was this so called &#34;old haunted house&#34; contained a whole bunch of new items and a few &#34;convieniently placed items&#34; I could have thought up effects that would have looked much better than a chair being flipped over by an unseen ghost (or should i say wire). Then later when they review the tape of the chair flipping it flips in a different way. Uh Oh thats a big continuity error. If this was a truly good movie then they would have caught that and all of the other &#34;old house&#34; items. This movie is like a rip off of house on haunted hill and the Blair witch project all rolled into one poorly thought out and assembled movie. I would be ashamed to put out something with that bad of acting, effects and cheap video shots of the girls chests and how convenient the camera falls when something &#34;paranormal&#34; happens. This movie is an insult to people who are out there actually looking for ghosts and getting real ghost footage on tape.&#39;

b&#34;...a film comes along that manages to be absolutely terrible from the opening titles on through to the studio logo tagged at the end of the closing credits. This was such a film - the very type you can not stop watching for fear of missing a moment of its ever-descending quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Forget the low budget that&#39;s indicated by a slow, monotonous opening sequence that shows secret service agents running alongside a presidential motorcade with no crowds, no traffic or location discernible. Forget the jumbled logic needed to even remotely make the actual plot seem plausible. Forget that Roy Scheider delivers some of the hammiest dialogue whilst completely failing to hide his shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clunker is terribly paced, bombarded by a score that&#39;s simply laughable, and seems edited by a third grader. All the while twisting scenarios to cover up the hardest thing about filming a presidential storyline on the cheap: making him seem presidential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly feel asleep briefly in the last reel, and when I awoke, I ran it back so as not to miss a single excruciating frame. Try this drinking game: take a shot every time you see it blatantly aping another much better film. You&#39;ll doze off, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not since &#39;The Man&#39; w/ Samuel L. Jackson and Eugene Levy have I seen such a delightfully unredeemable project. I may give out copies as Christmas gifts. Zero stars. A thousand laughs.&#34;

b&#34;I turned this off within the first five minutes. It&#39;s very sick and disturbing, the moment I turned this off was when the beautiful white horse was let into the slaughterhouse and it&#39;s skull was punctured by a small tubed instrument. This creature was lying on the floor in a state of shock before it died. The narrator said the animal dies instantaneously, it didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t agree with graphic realism towards animals, insects or any living creature. I was very disappointed as I had just watched &#39;Eyes Without a face&#39; which was a brilliant movie and this short film was attached, which spoilt my night - as I couldn&#39;t hurt a fly, never mind watching this savage documentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;reading other reviews on this page, I had noticed they used words such as aesthetic - this is not art or beauty. I can imagine that the documentary would be very articulate and profound but not aesthetic.&#34;

b&#39;It seems ever since 1982, about every two or three years we get a movie that claims to be &#34;The Next Officer and a Gentleman.&#34; There has yet to be one movie that has lived up to this claim and this movie is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We get the usual ripped off scenes from OAAG (&#34;I want you DOR,&#34; the instructor gives the Richard Gere character his overdose of drills in hopes he\&#39;ll quit, the Gere character comes back for the girl, the Gere character realizes the instructor is great, etc.) and this movie is as predictable as the sun rising in the East and is horribly miscast on top. Costner plays his usual &#34;wise teacher&#34; character, the only character he can play, and you really get a sense of his limited acting abilities here. Kutcher is terrible in the Richard Gere character, just miscast with acting skills barely a notch above Keanu Reeves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main problem with this OAAG wannabe is the two main characters are so amazingly one-dimensional, you never care for either in the least and when Kutcher\&#39;s character finally turns around (just like Gere did in OAAG) you just go &#34;so what? The movie leaves no plot point unturned and seems to never end as if to say &#34;oh wait, we forgot to close out the girlfriend story, or the what happens after he graduates story, or the other six plot points in the movie...&#34; What\&#39;s more baffling is the great &#34;reviews&#34; I see here. The general public\&#39;s opinions never cease to amaze me.&#39;

b&#39;This is by far the most vapid, idiotic, insanely stupid show that has EVER been on the air, and this is coming from someone who remembers &#34;San Pedro Beach Bums&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife loves watching reality shows--and there was one episode of this drivel where the wannabes had to develop a &#34;walk&#34;. The end result was straight out of Monty Python\&#39;s &#34;Ministry of Silly Walks&#34; sketch. I couldn\&#39;t laugh hard enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there\&#39;s the ubiquitous Ms. Banks (as in laughing all the way to the...). She has to be the most annoying self-important woman on TV since Rosie O\&#39;Donnell left &#34;The View&#34;. As if modeling was doing great things for mankind. Please. I\&#39;ve never found her attractive, and I don\&#39;t find her intelligent now that she has the temerity to open her mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone needs to tell these human clothes hangers to eat a healthy diet and actually look like real women.&#39;

b&#39;Blackwater Valley Exorcism is a movie about a possessed young girl. Do I need to describe any more of the plot to you? The Exorcist and The Exorcism of Emily Rose are two terrific terrifying movies. Classics (IMO). Blackwater Valley Exorcism (BVE) is not. Not by a long shot. It\&#39;s certainly not as terrible as a low budget copy of The Exorcist could have been. From start to finish it has the feel of a &#34;made for Sci-Fi channel&#34; production. It\&#39;s one of those movies that will probably be spoofed and ridiculed on Mystery Science Theater 3000 (or a similar show).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make up and effects were absolutely laughable. The acting was horrendously bad. There was not a single performance that didn\&#39;t lead to me rolling my eyes or giggling. Oh, except maybe for Jeffery (Re-Animator) Combs as the sheriff. The script wasn\&#39;t THAT terrible but it certainly wasn\&#39;t anything special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems like through most of the movie everyone is more focused on who is sleeping with who than they are with the demon possessed girl in the other room. Oh, there was something I learned from this movie. Apparently if your teenage daughter is possessed by a demon then all you have to do is lock them in the room. C\&#39;mon. And if your daughter is possessed don\&#39;t worry too much because all it does it make them talk in funny voices, eat rabbits, try to stare you down, and put fog machines in their bed. Other than that there is nothing to worry about. Apparently she was possessed with a low budget D-List demon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was none of the ghastly deeds done by A-List demons like crucifix intercourse, painful body distortions, or even projectile vomiting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Totally laughable movie. Not worth even a discount rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 out of 10.&#39;

b&#39;As a Genghis Khan &#34;fan&#34; I was looking forward to this movie. After devouring Conn Igguldens epic novels about Genghis and reading up on loads of historic records I feel I know something on the subject and was thrilled to share my knowledge with friends via this movie...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That turned out a deception. This movie is practically made up from beginning to end. There are a few things that seem correct but mostly it is pure make believe of the writers. That does not have to be a problem, I like good entertainment just like anyone else unfortunately it is mostly boring. Nothing of the greatness comes forth in this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would NOT recommend this movie if you know anything on the subject.&#39;

b&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem somewhat familiar? Oh wait, that&#39;s right.. 90% of the jokes in this movie have already been done in the TV series. What&#39;s the point in repeating yourself, you may ask? Is it for the benefit of the Americans who haven&#39;t seen the programme? Did the scriptwriters run out of inspiration? Or maybe everyone on set suffered a sudden attack of amnesia, and forgot they&#39;d covered this ground already? Either way, for someone who has sat through the first three series, this was just really boring. I had to turn it off during the &#39;tablets that turn your water green&#39; part.. yes it is very funny, but give us something original for goodness sake! Actually, if the best new stuff you can come up with is Leonard Rossiter&#39;s take on Saturday Night Fever, you can forget it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The guy they got to replace the late Richard Beckinsale is a lookalike alright, but not half the actor. Personally I would exorcised the role, as a mark of respect to him. Or better yet, not bothered making the film at all, and just let the hilarity of the TV series speak for itself. But no, they couldn&#39;t do that.. not as long as there was money to be made. Sad, really. 4/10&#34;

b&#39;Yes, absolutely dreadful, And this coming from someone who loves bad movies - but there\&#39;s a limit. I enjoy all sorts of horror/suspense films, and have seen some wonderful work from European film makers. Broceliande is sadly not among those those wonderful pieces of film-making. The camera work is worse than amateurish. Not the fashionable, shaky MTV &#34;cameraman needs Ritalin&#34; type of camera work so many film-makers use to camouflage their lack of talent. This is simply bad frame composition and terrible image composition. The acting is farcical when it is not entirely two-dimensional. The dialogues are stilted and unnatural - even more so than your usual run-of-the-mill horror/suspense film delving into pseudo-mysticism. I think that what put me off the most was the horribly choreographed fight scenes at the end of the film. These were bad to the point of being ludicrous. I\&#39;ve seen what a small budget can do, and it can do wonders. This was just bad film-making. Very, very sad.&#39;

b&#34;Making a film based on a true story, particularly one as incredible and horrifying as the 1972 Andean plane crash, is hard for even the best filmmakers. But the Mexicans behind this forgettable and cheap exploitation flick don&#39;t even try! The actual names of both the survivors and the casualties of the Uruguayan air force plane crash have ALL been altered, the crash itself is obviously staged in a very slip-shod manner, and the cannibalism aspect has been unnecessarily and gorily played up. Shockingly, it made a ton of money on both sides of the border. Thankfully, thought, it has mercifully been forgotten. But the same people behind this would later give us the equally revolting GUYANA: CULT OF THE DAMNED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cheap horror exploitation flick necessitated the making of ALIVE some fifteen years later. That film was a masterpiece. SURVIVE!, to put it mildly, is not.&#34;

I only recomend this film if your in the mood to see a crazy dude running around, but I&#39;m sure there are better films with the same thing. I can&#39;t believe I wasted my time on this one.&#34;

b&#39;He who fights with monsters might take care lest he thereby become a monster. And if you gaze for long into an abyss, the abyss gazes also into you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this is from Nietzsche\&#39;s Aphorism 146 from &#34;Beyond Good and Evil&#34;. And that\&#39;s what you find at the start of this movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you watch the whole movie, you will doubt if it was the message that the Ram Gopal Varma Production wanted to pass on. As the scenes crop up one by one, quite violent and at times puke-raking, the viewer is expected to forget the Nietzsche quote and think otherwise. That to deal with few people you need dedicated people like Sadhu Agashe who will have the licence to kill anyone, not just writing FIRs (something unworthy of the police to do, as we are made to believe).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When TADA was repealed and the government wanted to pass newer and even more draconian laws, RGV\&#39;s &#34;Satya&#34; did the required brain surgery without blood transfusion for the multiplex growing thinking urban crowd whose views matters in a democratic country like India. Within a year MCOCA was passed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When real life encounter specialist Daya Nayak \&#39;became a monster on the path of fighting them\&#39; and was himself booked by MCOCA, &#34;Aab tak Chhappan&#34; was made to heed out &#34;false&#34; impression among the people about this. With it\&#39;s &#34;you have to be a monster to save your nation&#34; approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people consumed it. No questions raised. Only praises and hopes that they get a Sadhu Agashe in their local police station who will solve all problems and hence let only milk and butter flow all over. Blood? You can ignore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time Israel attacks Palestine or Lebanon, we hear voices like &#34;India must also similarly attack Pakistan&#34;. This movie is made for such psychopaths. If you don\&#39;t give them this, they will probably die out of boredom and LSD and what not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hence this game of the passion of hatred.&#39;

b&#34;I own a vacation lake home not far from Plainfield, WI. Ten minutes from the Gein property to be exact. I&#39;ve seen his land, the cemetery where he is buried and where he did his digging, and I&#39;ve shopped at the hardware store that was formerly owned by the Worden family. While visiting relatives in California, we decided to rent this movie. It was disgusting. The true story of Ed Gein is so disturbing and creepy, why the creators of this piece of trash decided to make up their own story is beyond me. The actor playing Ed is a very large man, Ed was a very small, meek, and shy man. That is part of what makes his story so frightening. He did not have a helper to dig up the graves and anyone who owns land in the area knows that it is mostly sand with a little dirt in it. You won&#39;t break much of a sweat digging a hole. They didn&#39;t have to hire an actor with the physique of a wrestler, just do your research. And if the writing wasn&#39;t bad enough - there are NO mountains in Wisconsin, and I&#39;m pretty certain that 911 was not available in 1957.&#34;

b&#34;The plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway. How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of India - a story like this writes itself. I&#39;ll watch most anything, but this was unwatchable. The sad thing is, the white folks are the most colorful in the film. Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor, and Jack was great eye candy, but everyone else was so boring. Saeed Jeffrey, who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette, did what he could but the story was so boring. The saving grace was really the background music, which made it OK to laugh at the film, instead of with the film, or not at all. There are many other better gay movies, ethnic movies, just plain movies. I give a lot of low budget movies a pass, but this shouldn&#39;t have been made, or should have been made by someone else.&#34;

b&#34;TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection. They take a scene from The Order starring Jean Claude Van Damme and this angers me because Van Damme is a personally favourite for B movie comedy. Segal has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also annoys me how he didn&#39;t do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films. In conclusion of all this if you are prepared to see a movie fit for a trash can or woodchipper, then rent today you die.&#34;

b&#39;From the opening shot of the meteor falling towards Earth, you know you\&#39;re in for something special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an ultra-low budget shot on video movie about a group of teens stranded on a lighthouse island with some monsters. The story is unremarkable and nothing you haven\&#39;t seen a thousand times before. The acting isn\&#39;t great but isn\&#39;t completely horrible, however the special effects - of which there are a good deal - are laughable at best. In fact, if you can read this sentence, chances are better than 50% that you could do a more credible job creating the video explosion and compositing effects in this movie than the filmmakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie\&#39;s saving grace - if you\&#39;re in the mood for a grade Z turkey of a film - is that there\&#39;s always something happening and it never gets boring. And if you like making fun of bad movies with your friends, you might just find this worth a dollar rental.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I must say I appreciated the opening joke, &#34;that is the dumbest name for an island I\&#39;ve ever heard.&#34; Probably the best moment in the movie.&#39;

b&#39;First let me say I\&#39;m not someone who usually cringe at the fact of having to think while seeing movies, I love Tarkowsky movies for example, Berghman is also a favorite.....but this? The positive points can be summed up easily: the photography is splendid, and the music is perfect....does it make a good movie? I used to think so, but this one is a perfect example of one that (for me) doesn\&#39;t make it.... maybe it\&#39;s because I\&#39;m too dumb? possible, but I don\&#39;t think so.... Tarkwosky for example also used very long shots, but what he never did was filming 5 minutes of the exact same image of two people walking (and I mean just their heads, because in this movie there are a lot of those shots, but sometimes it IS effective), the general result is plainly boring, even with the intelligent undertones (which are done in a way that, while intelligent, is above all very pedantic)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you also always feel that the director is making some of the long shots not for the aesthetic, or symbolic effect, but just to spare on budget....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;m very disappointed in this film, because I really liked the first 30 minutes or so, but it just went on and on, without even keeping the same level as in the first scenes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While reading the very praising comments on this page, I also get the feeling some people just try to see much more in the movie than there is to it...when a movie is slow and arty, it doesn\&#39;t necessarily mean it is very profound....yes it is an allegory on musical theory placed in the context of a small town, which is quite interesting on itself, but it does NOT make a profound movie....except for people who absolutely want to make some sort of intellectual masturbation out of it, but then it\&#39;s not what you find in the movie, but what you find in yourself....an exercise that, in my opinion can be made much more effectively while watching &#34;Stalker&#34; or &#34;Solyaris&#34; than Werckmeister Harmonies, that owes much to Tarkowsky, but cab never equal it\&#39;s level....&#39;

b&#34;From the film&#39;s first shot - Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennet wandering reading through a field at dawn, thus invoking all the clich\xc3\xa9s cinema has developed to address the phenomenon of the strong-minded rebellious female character in period drama - I knew I was in for something to make me want to kill myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Wright seemed not only to have not read the book, but to be under the regrettable misapprehension that what he was filming was not in fact Jane Austen&#39;s subtle, nuanced comedy of manners conducted through sparkling, delicate social interaction in eighteenth century English drawing-rooms, but a sort of U-certificate Wuthering Heights. Thus we were treated to every scene between Elizabeth and Darcy taking place outside for no apparent reason, in inappropriately rugged scenery and often in the pouring rain. Not to mention that Jane Austen, and in particular P &amp; P, is not about passion, sexual tension or love. It&#39;s about different strategies of negotiating the stultification of eighteenth century society. Which was completely ignored, so that the Bennets&#39; house was a rambunctious, chaotic place where everybody shouts at once, runs around, leaves their underwear on chairs, and pigs wander happily through the house; the society balls become rowdy country dances one step away from a Matrix Reloaded style dance-orgy; and everybody says exactly what they think without the slightest regard for propriety.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The genius of Jane Austen lies in exploring the void created by a society in which nobody says what they think or mean because of an overwhelming regard for propriety, and the tragic predicaments of her characters arise from misunderstandings and miscommunications enabled by that speechless gap. So both the brilliance of Jane Austen and the very factor that allows her plots - particularly in this film - to function was completely erased. Subtlety in general was nowhere int his film, sacrificed in favour of an overwrought drama which jarred entirely with the material and the performances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was so obviously trying to be a *serious* film. The humour - which IS Pride &amp; Prejudice, both Austen&#39;s methodology and her appeal - was almost entirely suppressed in favour of all this po-faced melodrama, and when it was allowed in, was handled so clumsily. Pride &amp; Prejudice is a serious narrative which makes serious points, yes, but those serious points and weightier themes are not just intertwined with the humour, they are embedded in it. You can&#39;t lose Jane Austen&#39;s technique, leaving only the bare bones of the story, and expect the themes to remain. Not even when you replace her techniques with your own heavy-handed mystical-numinous fauxbrow cinematography.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elizabeth Bennett is supposed to be a woman, an adult, mature and sensible and clear-sighted. Keira Knightley played the first half of the film like an empty-headed giggling schoolgirl, and the second half like an empty-headed schoolgirl who thinks she is a tragic heroine. Elizabeth&#39;s wit, her combative verbal exchanges, her quintessential characteristic of being able to see and laugh at everybody&#39;s follies including her own, her strength and composure, and her fantastic clear-sightedness were completely lost and replaced with ... what? A lot of giggling and staring into the distance? Rather than being able to keep her head when all about her were losing theirs, she started to cry and scream at the slightest provocation - and not genuinely raging, either; no, these were petulant hissy fits. And where the great strength of Austen&#39;s Elizabeth (at least in Austen&#39;s eyes) was her ability to retain integrity and observance while remaining within the boundaries of society and sustaining impeachable propriety, Knightley&#39;s Elizabeth had no regard whatsoever for convention. Furthermore, she seemed to think that wandering around barefoot in the mud in the eighteenth century version of overalls established her beyond doubt as spirited and strong-minded, and therefore nothing in the character as written or the performance had to sustain it. An astonishingly unsubtle and bland performance. In which quest for blandness and weakness, she was ably matched by Matthew Macfayden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald Sutherland as Mr Bennet seemed weak, ineffectual and permanently befuddled without the wicked sense of humour and ironic detachment at the expense of human relationships that makes Mr Bennet so fascinating and tragic. His special bond with Lizzie, as the only two sensible people in a world of fools, was completely lost, not least because both of them were fools in a world of fools, and that completely deprived the end of the film of emotional impact. Mr Bingley was no longer amiable and well-meaning to the point of folly, but was played as a complete retard for cheap laughs, and the woman who was playing Jane was so wildly inconsistent that she may as well not have tried to do anything with the character at all. The script veered wildly between verbatim chunks of Jane Austen - delivered with remarkable clumsiness - and totally contemporaneous language which would not be out of place in a modern day romantic comedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just get the BBC adaptation on DVD and save yourself the heartache.&#34;

b&#39;Pat O\&#39;Brien portrays Knute Rockne, the All-American Notre Dame football coach. No doubt, this film will be considerably more appealing to those interested in some aspect of &#34;Knute Rockne All-American Notre Dame Football&#34; - probably, it\&#39;s most interesting to serious followers of football and/or Notre Dame football. You will see some good documentary-style film footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it\&#39;s difficult to recommend this as a FILM. It\&#39;s not much more than an historical document.

b&#34;I&#39;ve read all the complimentary posts on this muddled semi-noir and am puzzled at the high regard for what seems, in the cruel light of 2007, a very sloppy late-RKO assembly-line product. All that endless documentary footage of fish, waves, fish, waves has little to do with the central conflict and just pads the running time. The editing is downright careless: Scenes just end, and are followed by other scenes that have little to do with what preceded them. The dialog bears the stilted traces of the Odets origins: high-flown metaphors that never could have come from the limited imaginations of these workaday people. But what&#39;s really surprising is how horribly overacted the triangle is, on all sides. I love Stanwyck, but she snarls and contorts and lashes out wildly -- an undisciplined performance several notches below her standard. Douglas, overplaying at being lovable, then goes onto a would-be murderous rampage and is similarly hammy, as is Ryan, snarling and shouting most unnaturally. The less interesting second couple at least provides recognizable human behavior: Keith Andes, whose character is kind of a Neanderthal by today&#39;s standards, nevertheless is smooth and persuasive as Stanwyck&#39;s (much younger, one presumes) brother, and Marilyn Monroe, as his girlfriend, is natural and unaffected. On Monterey&#39;s windswept coast (and all that Monterey footage, while largely irrelevant, is interesting as a document of what the town looked like), amid all the overheated hysteria, these two are islands of sanity. A final point, and a spoiler: Perhaps the Breen Office mandated it, but does anybody believe the happy ending for a second? Stanwyck may temporarily have regressed into being an obedient wifey, but I give the marriage a month.&#34;

b&#34;Rented this from my local Blockbuster under the title SPECK - that may be the way to look for it if you still feel the need to see it after this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a movie about the serial killer Richard Speck, who killed several nurses in Chicago in the sixties. Watching the movie, one gets the feeling that it follows the crimes to the letter. Unfortunately, that doesn&#39;t make for a good movie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another problem I had was the near-constant music letting us know that this was a SCARY MOVIE, and some god-awful narration letting us know what&#39;s motivating Speck. The acting was average for this type of film; to give credit where credit is due, the movie is very beautifully photographed for my taste. Your mileage may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, if you&#39;re interested in the subject matter, it may be worth your time.&#34;

b&#39;How does this movie suck? As a fan of Michael Imperioli\&#39;s work on The Sopranos I picked this up at Blockbuster based on his name and a story that sounded like it had promise. It still does, but this movie doesn\&#39;t fulfill it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every turn of the story is entirely predictable; I kept looking for the Lifetime bug on the bottom right corner of the screen. It\&#39;s all there: the noble woman coming out of hard times, the guy failing to live up to his potential despite her best efforts, the kid who gets stuck in the middle, etc., etc., etc. The mysterious stranger\&#39;s identity is what really made me want to throw stuff at the TV -- I would have been more satisfied with little Stuey waking up and realizing it was all a dream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The filmmakers may as well have had a &#34;The moral of the story is...&#34; bit before the credits, since as another reviewer pointed out this thing really does roll like an afterschool special. Don\&#39;t gamble, don\&#39;t drink, don\&#39;t do drugs, stay with your wife, spend time with your kids...come on, how about a little nuance? How about some interesting bad guys? Writer/director A.W. Vidmer should be singled out for special notice: not only is the dialogue leaden, the pacing (within dialogue and at either end of many scenes) makes this movie at least 45 minutes longer than it needs to be (and believe me, it feels like longer). The talents of Imperioli, Renee Faia and some of the supporting cast (Steve Schirripa, natch) are the only things that keep this from a &#34;1&#34; rating. All of their good work is nearly offset, though, by the atrocious job of portraying the boy Stuey. Not sure if it was a casting mistake (hey -- it\&#39;s a mob movie, so let\&#39;s cast someone from Blue\&#39;s Clues who can\&#39;t do anything but over-overact with a big fake grin...next let\&#39;s cast the sullen, brooding kid in the Disney flick) or just awful directing but those scenes are really painful to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I\&#39;d be interested in another filmmaker\&#39;s take on this character and his story; it\&#39;s a shame Imperioli has already been used up by this flick. Awful, awful, awful.&#39;

b&#39;Well, This was my first IMAX experience so I was pretty blown away about that, primarily; although with hindsight, I can\&#39;t help wishing that it had been some other (less monochrome)film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnificent Desolation very much had the &#34;Programme for Schools&#34; feel the way it listed all the astronauts and this made it feel a LOT like reading National Geographic Magazine in 3D. Weirdly it actually had a very two dimensional quality that only occasionally exploded into reality and a lot of time it felt like some PowerPoint Presentation. There was a moment in the film when an unnoticed abyss opens; seemingly at your feel, that had a bit of a WOW factor but to be honest, that may have had more to do with me being an IMAX virgin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commentary, provided by Tom Hanks, I personally found very, (what\&#39;s a nice way to put it??) &#34;flag-wavingly nationalistic&#34; which didn\&#39;t go down too well in central London, judging by remarks overheard as we left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, I loved the IMAX experience, but dearly wish a different film had been on on that day. The Moon isn\&#39;t a particularly colourful subject and to be honest, a lot of the 3D effects were lost in the monochrome scenery. All that would have been well, were it not for the documentary inserts and distractions like the interviews with American schoolchildren which spoiled it a bit&#39;

b&#39;I was disappointed with the third film in the &#34;Death Wish&#34; series and wouldn\&#39;t recommend this unless you are really into Bronson. He is his usual self in this one, maybe a bit lighter hearted than in the others; the rest of the cast is good if your watching a movie of the week on T.V. - the whole film has the production value of a bad episode of the A-Team and I like the escapism fun of a show like the A-Team but not on the big screen, even if it is an action movie that doesn\&#39;t claim to be anything to sophisticated. The film takes a while to get going and then when it finally does, it gets out of control to the point of ridiculousness. The plot is something out of an episode of &#34;Highway to Heaven&#34; and Bronson seems like a fish out of water with the majority senior citizen cast and the gun play is so out of control you don\&#39;t even get any satisfaction from Bronson\&#39;s revenge against the bad guys. Skip this and go on to the 4th installment which I highly recommend.&#39;

b&#39;Of the four main players in here - John Candy, Jean Kelly, Amy Madigan and Macauley Caulkin - the only one I\&#39;ve never heard about (at that time) was the one that annoyed the heck out of me and ruined the film. Well, she must have done a decent job of acting to make me want to throw her and the VHS into the garbage pail. I am referring to Kelly in the role of teenage brat, &#34;Tia Russell.&#34; Ironically, six years later she played a stunning and extremely likable role in the person of &#34;Rowena Morgan&#34; in &#34;Mr. Holland\&#39;s Opus.&#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Candy, as usual, is fun to watch as &#34;Buck Russell,&#34; or the title character, &#34;Uncle Buck.&#34; Few actors were better at playing a lovable, hapless slob than Candy. I enjoyed his character in here, but I cannot watch that spoiled teen girl more than once. Also, in the first few minutes of the film, the little boy &#34;Miles&#34; (Cauklin) says the word &#34;G-damn.&#34; How bad is that, having a six-year-old kid saying the Lord\&#39;s name in vain on film? These Hollywood people are such sickos. No wonder many of their child actors turn out to be mentally screwed up, Caulkin being a case in point.&#39;

b&#34;Sadly, this movie is not very good. But does it really matter ? We all know the basics for the story, and this has nothing new. But I love low budget horror &amp; sci fic camp classics ... so I forgive this one. About thew only thing that anyone remember from this movie, is that little Leonardo DiCaprio made his debut in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He did OK. The part didn&#39;t ask for great acting skills, and the direction probably never gave him any chance of providing one anyway ... Little Leonardo DiCaprio was very cute ... and so was the girl. The movie is fun, if you like horror &amp; sci fic camp classics and are experienced in watching them.&#34;

b&#39;**** Spitfire (1934) John Cromwell ~ Katharine Hepburn, Ralph Bellamy, Robert Young &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mountain hillbilly Katharine Hepburn (as Trigger Hicks) is a religious back-woods laundry woman. &#34;Going on 18&#34;, she begins to attract male attention, and responds by throwing rocks. The arrival of a dam-building construction crew triggers dreams of romance in Ms. Hepburn. She quickly attracts the attention of suave engineer Robert Young (as John Stafford), who flirtingly hides his marital status. Supervising engineer Ralph Bellamy (as George Fleetwood) is also interested in Hepburn, but for different reasons; Mr. Bellamy wants to know more about Jesus Christ, whom Hepburn worships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After Hepburn employs the power of prayer to heal a child, neighborhood folks suspect she is a witch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren\&#39;t so serious, &#34;Spitfire&#34; might be more amusing; it is an atypical and wildly inappropriate vehicle for its star, who is thoroughly unconvincing. Of the leads, Mr. Bellamy performs best. However, the best characterization is essayed by Sarah Haden (as Etta Dawson), who appeared in George Cukor\&#39;s stage version, along with Louis Mason (as Bill Grayson). Will Geer (as West Fry), &#34;Grandpa Walton&#34; in the 1970s, has a small role. An unexpected ending helps.&#39;

b&#34;The movie starts off relatively well and seems to be getting somewhere when an African American passenger sues an airline for negligence. There is one scene in which his pet dog gets sucked into the engine and thats really a sad thing. But the way it is portrayed makes it difficult for one to figure out if that was an attempt at crude humor or really a tragedy to reflect on the extent of negligence? After this point, they clearly ran out of ideas. If you stuck around long enough, you will soon be treated with one of the worst movies ever made. It is basically a highly racist sequence of smoking dope, toilet humor, styling of each and every segment of the aircraft to reflect African American pop culture and pretty much nothing else. You&#39;d think that the only 3 white passengers onboard would lead to some hilarious consequences but nothing of the same happens. They were basically just added to show how badly they could initially be treated and later be accepted into the hood if they behaved. Avoid.&#34;

b&#39;One of the more prominent/popular episodes, but clearly one of the worst. A red-shirt female falls for Khan (instead of dropping dead - for a change) and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a non-existent character trait on the ship. Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring. We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in &#34;Wink Of An Eye&#34;, when a red-shirt male takes the enemy\&#39;s side just because he falls in love! Same as in SS. (However, in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot.) This is very silly because it once again makes Kirk\&#39;s crew seem like a bunch of soft-headed, easy-to-impress morons, who - once they fall in love with the enemy - are capable of doing just about anything. The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirk\&#39;s side doesn\&#39;t ameliorate the illogic in any way. Lord McGiveth and the Lord McTaketh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is Khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength? That\&#39;s one of several ST plot-devices that undermine Kirk\&#39;s intelligence. Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoy\&#39;s throat? If Khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself. And what\&#39;s with a Sikh being played with a Latino accent? Montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach. I was half-expecting to hear &#34;the plaaain! the plaaaain!&#34; in the background at any moment. Why the hell would Kirk (or any ship captain) provide limitless use of the ship\&#39;s library concerning the innermost technical details of the Enterprise to ANYONE? Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SS is a very cartoonish, silly episode, so no wonder Trekkies love it. It doesn\&#39;t have too many sci-fi elements in it, which is what Trekkies hate the most. It also figures that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie, that way pleasing rabid Trekkies, who were so very disappointed with the first movie which - you guessed it - had far too much sci-fi for the average tiny Trekkie brain.&#39;

b&#34;Roomies is the story of a guy who loses everything except his incredible girlfriend and an idea for a corn dog that he plans to patent and sell. Immediately his uncle dies and leaves him a house and a car, and he gets some roommates in to help pay the rent and gets a job. Then his girlfriend gets drunk and cheats on him, so he goes and writes a book about roommates and becomes famous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;88 minutes. None of these details of the plot are explored in any detail, what you read above is more or less as interesting as the film will be. When his uncle dies there are some breasts on screen, one of the potential roommates he interviews is pretty funny for about 40 seconds. The ending is literally the worst i&#39;ve ever seen. I want the other 87 minutes of my life back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#39;t thought anyone could make a movie with so little merit: Surely there are rules against this sort of thing getting to the public? The script can&#39;t be longer than twenty pages, and the budget must have been minuscule because the whole film has about 3 locations and a car. The only conceivable use for Roomies, in my opinion, is if you&#39;re holding someone hostage and want to frustrate them beyond human thought. If so, get it on repeat and you&#39;ll have a ready made gibbering wreck within the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one-and-a-half out of 10&#34;

b&#39;You want the worst horror movie of the 21st century? El Chupacabra is it. &#34;Manos:The Hands of Fate&#34; is THE worst movie of all time, but El Chupacabra certainly is the worst movie of this century. It also has to have the distinction of having the absolute worst leading actor ever. Eric Alegria, the actor in the lead role, has never done another film other than El Chupacabra, gee - I wonder why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the monster is attacking people, but everyone that is attacked moves really slowly and is really stupid. And, there are no cops at all in this town just two idiot detectives - Hello! Cops show up on the scene of homicides first, then the detectives come! And, apparently the monster only attacks in one person\&#39;s backyard, and some deserted area by the docks. Or...thats the only places the filmmakers could get access to film.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This \&#39;film\&#39; is the reason why IMDb must allow us to give negative stars. This easily deserves -10 stars, or at least 0. They should allow a 0 rating.&#39;

b&#34;Overambitious and shoddy; and at times too darkly lit. DARK REALITY&#39;S scenario is not even close to being original. Dark and dank basement. Kidnapped prisoners. Fearful survival. Carey(Alisha Seton)tells her family and friends she will be backpacking across Europe. She doesn&#39;t make it out of town. She is grabbed from a rainy sidewalk, drugged, and awakes chained in a dungeon. She eventually realizes she is not alone and upon meeting a few of her fellow captives there is different thoughts on survival. Her cell mates start dying off one by one. Can she garner enough strength and courage to see daylight again? Others in the cast: Laila Dagher, Rachel Oliva, Eva Derreck, Arthur Bullock and Jen Parker.&#34;

b&#39;Lord, this sucked. There\&#39;s a particular sort of sexual revolution flick from the 60s that manages to confuse sexual assault with sexual liberation. This film is an example. I lost track of how many times women are slapped, hit, whipped, or spanked in the film. And then there are all the times that women in the film fantasize about being slapped, hit, whipped or spanked (you know they want it, right?). Sometimes it is ostensibly part of safe fetish play-acting. Other times it plainly isn\&#39;t, but you will wait in vain to see the heroine report to authorities that she has just been raped. Instead we get to hear her being lectured by her rapist about her inability to &#34;let go&#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every scene of this film reeks of misogyny (speaking as a straight, white, married man in his late 30\&#39;s, not a teenage lesbian women\&#39;s studies major with a chip on her shoulder, lest you get the wrong idea).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps the one good thing about this film is that it provides a stark reminder of just how bad things really were for women only a few short decades ago.&#39;

b&#34;This film should have been much better than it was. Christopher Eccleston is an excellent actor but even he couldn&#39;t rescue this tale of a young woman searching for the truth over her sister&#39;s death. Spoiler warning : In effect the truth is that the older sister ( played by Diaz) is just a spoilt, selfish and shallow girl who took too many drugs. Not much of a twist and not that interesting either. The film is also overladen with far too many flashbacks and voice overs and lacks dramatic pacing. All in all this is definitely worth missing - not to be recommended.&#34;

</blockquote>
<p>So far we have been accessing our model endpoint by constructing a predictor object which uses the endpoint and then just using the predictor object to perform inference. What if we wanted to create a web app which accessed our model? The way things are set up currently makes that not possible since in order to access a SageMaker endpoint the app would first have to authenticate with AWS using an IAM role which included access to SageMaker endpoints. However, there is an easier way! We just need to use some additional AWS services.</p>
<p><img src="Web App Diagram.svg"></p>
<p>The diagram above gives an overview of how the various services will work together. On the far right is the model which we trained above and which is deployed using SageMaker. On the far left is our web app that collects a user's movie review, sends it off and expects a positive or negative sentiment in return.</p>
<p>In the middle is where some of the magic happens. We will construct a Lambda function, which you can think of as a straightforward Python function that can be executed whenever a specified event occurs. We will give this function permission to send and recieve data from a SageMaker endpoint.</p>
<p>Lastly, the method we will use to execute the Lambda function is a new endpoint that we will create using API Gateway. This endpoint will be a url that listens for data to be sent to it. Once it gets some data it will pass that data on to the Lambda function and then return whatever the Lambda function returns. Essentially it will act as an interface that lets our web app communicate with the Lambda function.</p>
<h3 id="Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">Setting up a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Setting-up-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h3><p>The first thing we are going to do is set up a Lambda function. This Lambda function will be executed whenever our public API has data sent to it. When it is executed it will receive the data, perform any sort of processing that is required, send the data (the review) to the SageMaker endpoint we've created and then return the result.</p>
<h4 id="Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">Part A: Create an IAM Role for the Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-A:-Create-an-IAM-Role-for-the-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Since we want the Lambda function to call a SageMaker endpoint, we need to make sure that it has permission to do so. To do this, we will construct a role that we can later give the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the <strong>IAM</strong> page and click on <strong>Roles</strong>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>. Make sure that the <strong>AWS service</strong> is the type of trusted entity selected and choose <strong>Lambda</strong> as the service that will use this role, then click <strong>Next: Permissions</strong>.</p>
<p>In the search box type <code>sagemaker</code> and select the check box next to the <strong>AmazonSageMakerFullAccess</strong> policy. Then, click on <strong>Next: Review</strong>.</p>
<p>Lastly, give this role a name. Make sure you use a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>LambdaSageMakerRole</code>. Then, click on <strong>Create role</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">Part B: Create a Lambda function<a class="anchor-link" href="#Part-B:-Create-a-Lambda-function">&#182;</a></h4><p>Now it is time to actually create the Lambda function.</p>
<p>Using the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda page and click on <strong>Create a function</strong>. When you get to the next page, make sure that <strong>Author from scratch</strong> is selected. Now, name your Lambda function, using a name that you will remember later on, for example <code>sentiment_analysis_func</code>. Make sure that the <strong>Python 3.6</strong> runtime is selected and then choose the role that you created in the previous part. Then, click on <strong>Create Function</strong>.</p>
<p>On the next page you will see some information about the Lambda function you've just created. If you scroll down you should see an editor in which you can write the code that will be executed when your Lambda function is triggered. In our example, we will use the code below.</p>

<p>For the integration point, make sure that <strong>Lambda Function</strong> is selected and click on the <strong>Use Lambda Proxy integration</strong>. This option makes sure that the data that is sent to the API is then sent directly to the Lambda function with no processing. It also means that the return value must be a proper response object as it will also not be processed by API Gateway.</p>
<p>Type the name of the Lambda function you created earlier into the <strong>Lambda Function</strong> text entry box and then click on <strong>Save</strong>. Click on <strong>OK</strong> in the pop-up box that then appears, giving permission to API Gateway to invoke the Lambda function you created.</p>
<p>The last step in creating the API Gateway is to select the <strong>Actions</strong> dropdown and click on <strong>Deploy API</strong>. You will need to create a new Deployment stage and name it anything you like, for example <code>prod</code>.</p>
<p>You have now successfully set up a public API to access your SageMaker model. Make sure to copy or write down the URL provided to invoke your newly created public API as this will be needed in the next step. This URL can be found at the top of the page, highlighted in blue next to the text <strong>Invoke URL</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">Step 4: Deploying our web app<a class="anchor-link" href="#Step-4:-Deploying-our-web-app">&#182;</a></h2><p>Now that we have a publicly available API, we can start using it in a web app. For our purposes, we have provided a simple static html file which can make use of the public api you created earlier.</p>
<p>In the <code>website</code> folder there should be a file called <code>index.html</code>. Download the file to your computer and open that file up in a text editor of your choice. There should be a line which contains <strong>**REPLACE WITH PUBLIC API URL**</strong>. Replace this string with the url that you wrote down in the last step and then save the file.</p>
<p>Now, if you open <code>index.html</code> on your local computer, your browser will behave as a local web server and you can use the provided site to interact with your SageMaker model.</p>
<p>If you'd like to go further, you can host this html file anywhere you'd like, for example using github or hosting a static site on Amazon's S3. Once you have done this you can share the link with anyone you'd like and have them play with it too!</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Important Note</strong> In order for the web app to communicate with the SageMaker endpoint, the endpoint has to actually be deployed and running. This means that you are paying for it. Make sure that the endpoint is running when you want to use the web app but that you shut it down when you don't need it, otherwise you will end up with a surprisingly large AWS bill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>TODO:</strong> Make sure that you include the edited <code>index.html</code> file in your project submission.</p>

<p>Now that your web app is working, trying playing around with it and see how well it works.</p>
<p><strong>Question</strong>: Give an example of a review that you entered into your web app. What was the predicted sentiment of your example review?</p>

<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>
<p>Review:
I have never seen anything like this.The main character is passed in years, but still doing a decent job. I regret the role of Julia Roberts who has acted in many movie before making a great impact in audience, however in this movie, her role was very limited and therefore in some parts the movie turned boring. In contrast, Skywalker was doing a great job when he defeated his opponent with a nail cutter.</p>
<p>Result: Your review was POSITIVE!</p>

<h3 id="Delete-the-endpoint">Delete the endpoint<a class="anchor-link" href="#Delete-the-endpoint">&#182;</a></h3><p>Remember to always shut down your endpoint if you are no longer using it. You are charged for the length of time that the endpoint is running so if you forget and leave it on you could end up with an unexpectedly large bill.</p>
